Greek Salad (transcribed)

Dressing
1   cup olive oil
2   tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1   tablespoon oregano
2   tablespoons fresh minced garlic
1/2 tablespoon dried basil
2   teaspoons (or to taste) salt
3   tablespoons red wine vinegar
3   tablespoons parmesan cheese

Salad
2   heads romaine lettuce, chopped
2   large tomatoes, cut in wedges
1   large cucumber, julienned
1   red onion, cut in slices
1/2 lb feta cheese, crumbled
1   cup Greek olives or regular black olive
    black pepper

Prepare dressing by blending or processing all ingredients together.
Prepare salad in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over salad, toss to cover.

Notes: Good; easy to make. The recipe as is will make a very large salad.
We usually let people add tomatoes/feta/olives on their own. The leftover
greens keep much better that way. The viniagrette is superior!


IHOP Pumpkin Pancakes (transcribed)

2 eggs
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
4 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons canned pumpkin
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon allspice

1. Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Coat pan with oil cooking spray.
2. Combine eggs, buttermilk, butter, pumpkin, sugar, and salt in a large
   bowl. Use an electric mixer to blend ingredients.
3. Combine remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Add dry ingredients to wet
   ingredients and blend with mixer until smooth.

6. Flip the pancakes and cook other side for the same amount of time, until
   dark brown.



CHICKEN TIKKA (transcribed)

In Indian cooking, tikka refers to chunks of meat cooked on skewers.

Active time: 1 1/2 hr Start to finish: 14 hr (includes marinating chicken and
preparing accompaniments)

3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted
3/4 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted
2 cups whole-milk yogurt
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 (1 1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil plus additional for greasing pan
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon garam masala (Indian spice mixture)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
5 lb skinless boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes (how many people are you feeding??)

Special equipment: 20 (12-inch) wooden skewers
Accompaniments: mango and red pepper chutney and mint raita
Garnish: lime wedges

Purée all ingredients except chicken in a blender until spices are well ground.

Put chicken in a large bowl, or divide between 2 large sealable plastic bags,
and add yogurt mixture, stirring or turning to coat. Marinate chicken, covered
and chilled (turning occasionally if using bags), at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.

Soak skewers in water 30 minutes. While skewers are soaking, bring chicken to
room temperature.

Preheat broiler and brush a broiler pan lightly with oil.

Divide chicken among skewers (about 5 cubes per skewer), leaving an 1/8-inch
space between cubes, and arrange about 5 skewers across pan. Broil chicken
about 4 inches from heat, turning over once, until browned in spots and just
cooked through, 9 to 12 minutes total.

Notes: This is really good. Feel free to go heavy on the spices; I didn't feel what I added
was in danger of overwhelming the yogurt. I just broiled the chicken pieces. It was good but
I'd have preferred using the grill. You have to make due in the Winter! Will definitely make 
this again.



Spicy Turkey Burgers

1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Mix together and form into 4 burgers. Cook to well-done and eat.



Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Galumpkis)

Sweet and Sour Tomato Sauce
  Note: You might want to make a larger batch of this sauce
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, smashed
1 1/2 quarts crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Cabbage Rolls
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
Splash dry red wine
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups steamed white rice
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 large heads green cabbage, about 3 pounds each

To make the sauce:
Coat a 3-quart saucepan with the oil and place over medium heat.
Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. 
Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Add the vinegar and sugar; simmer, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.

Place a skillet over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.
Sauté the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes, until soft.
Stir in the tomato paste, a splash of wine, parsley, and 1/2 cup of the prepared 
  sweet and sour tomato sauce, mix to incorporate and then take it off the heat.
Combine the ground meat in a large mixing bowl.
Add the egg, the cooked rice, and the sauteed onion mixture.
Toss the filling together with your hands to combine, season with a generous amount 
  of salt and pepper.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Remove the large, damaged outer leaves from the cabbages and set aside.
Cut out the cores of the cabbages with a sharp knife and carefully pull off all the rest of 
  the leaves, keeping them whole and as undamaged as possible, (get rid of all the small 
  leaves and use them for coleslaw or whatever.)
Blanch the cabbage leaves in the pot of boiling water for 5 minutes, or until pliable.
Run the leaves under cool water then lay them out so you can assess just how many blankets you 
  have to wrap up the filling.
Next, carefully cut out the center vein from the leaves so they will be easier to roll up.
Take the reserved big outer leaves and lay them on the bottom of a casserole pan, let part of 
  the leaves hang out the sides of the pan. This insulation will prevent the cabbage rolls from 
  burning on the bottom when baked.
Use all the good looking leaves to make the cabbage rolls.
Put about 1/2 cup of the meat filling in the center of the cabbage and starting at what was the stem-end, 
  fold the sides in and roll up the cabbage to enclose the filling. Place the cabbage rolls side by side 
  in rows, seam-side down, in a casserole pan.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pour the remaining sweet and sour tomato sauce over the cabbage rolls. Fold the hanging leaves over the 
top to enclose and keep the moisture in. Drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. 
Bake for 1 hour until the meat is cooked.

Notes: Very good. Takes a good bit of work; it helps to have more than one person working, especially when 
it comes to removing cabbage leaves from the heads of cabbage. The amount of sauce made is just enough to 
do the job; more would probably be better.



STUFFED PEPPERS CHRISTINE
(Recipe by Jon's grandmother)

6 large green peppers
1 c. fast-cooking rice
1 28-oz can tomato pieces (save liquid)
1/2 lb. ground beef or venison
1 lb. bulk hot sausage
sugar, garlic salt, black pepper, Tabasco sauce
ketchup or chili sauce
brown sugar
about 3 slices uncooked bacon

Cut the tops off the green peppers.  Chop the tops to use later.  Remove seeds and guts from 
inside the peppers and parboil peppers for about 4-5 min.  Drain and cool.

Bring the tomatoes and their liquid to a boil in a fairly large saucepan.  Add the rice; stir; 
remove from heat and let stand for at least 5 min.

Brown the ground beef, sausage, and chopped green pepper tops till meat is cooked.  Pour off any 
grease. Add rice mixture to meat mixture along with seasonings to suit your taste.  Spoon into the 
green peppers, placing peppers in a shallow pan or casserole dish.

Add a healthy hunk of brown sugar to about 1/2 or 2/3 c. ketchup or chili sauce.  Spoon a bit onto 
the top of each filled pepper.  Use more or less as desired.

Now top each stuffed pepper with about half a slice of bacon.  Add about 1/2 inch of water to casserole 
dish (so bottom of peppers don't dry out/burn).  Bake at 350 for about 45 min.  If the bacon needs a little
more cooking, put the peppers under the broiler BRIEFLY.  Normally the bacon gets done in the alotted baking time.

Note: I have frequently skipped the parboiling step and stuffed the raw pepper shells. They seem to hold together 
better during the 45 minute baking time and are almost always sufficiently done (at least tender-crisp) even 
at the bottom of the pepper.


Margaritaville

Red Lobster Parrot Bay Coconut Shrimp

Pina Colada Dipping Sauce
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup pina colada mix
1/4 cup crushed pineapple (canned)
2 tablespoons granulated sugar

Shrimp
6 to 8 cups canola oil (as required by fryer)
12 large shrimp, peeled and deveined (about 1/2 pound)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay coconut rum
1 cup panko Japanese breadcrumbs
1/2 cup shredded coconut

1. Prepare pina colada dipping sauce first by combining all the ingredients.
   Cover this and let it chill out in the fridge while you make the shrimp.
2. Heat oil to 350 degrees.
3. Measure 3/4 cup of flour into a medium bowl. In another medium bowl mix
   together the remaining 3/4 cup flour, sugar, and salt. Stir milk and rum
   into flour mixture. Let this batter stand for five minutes. While the
   batter rests, combine panko breadcrumbs and shredded coconut into a third
   medium bowl.
4. Butterfly cut each shrimp before you start the battering: Use a sharp
   knife to slice through the top of the shrimp (where the vein was) so that
   you can spread the shrimp open. Leave the tail intact.
5. To batter the shrimp, dip each one in the flour, then the wet batter, then
   coat each shrimp with the panko/coconut mixture. Arrange the shrimp on a
   plate until all of them are battered.
6. Fry the shrimp by dropping six at a time into the hot oil for 2 to 3
   minutes or until the shrimp are golden brown. Remove shrimp to a rack or
   paper towels to drain.
7. Serve shrimp with pina colada dipping sauce on the side, along with a
   small dish or your favorite salsa.

Moldavian Potato, Feta and Scallion Salad

This Salata de Cartofi cu Brinza is a delightful alternative to traditional
potato salad. The recipe calls for red skinned potatoes, but it's grand with
others too. Originally from Please to the Table, a Russian Cookbook  Jul 23,
2004

6     medium red potatoes
1/3   cup olive oil
2     cloves garlic, crushed in a garlic press
1     cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/2   cup scallions, finely chopped
3     tablespoons red wine vinegar
2     tablespoons finely chopped dill
      salt & freshly ground black pepper
6     black olives or 6 slices roasted red peppers (optional)

1. Clean and cook potatoes in boiling water until tender, 18-20 minutes.
2. Chop, press and crumble other ingredients.
3. Cool potatoes until they can be handled, then dice into 3/4 inch cubes.
4. Toss with olive oil and garlic, then let fully cool to room temperature.
5. Add feta and scallions and drizzle with vinegar.
6. Add dill, salt& pepper, and toss gently.
7. Let rest for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to mingle.
8. Add optional garnish and serve.

Notes: A really great potato salad variant. No mayo needed! We substituted some diced
red onion for the scallions, which seemed to be a fine addition. When assembled everything
has a great savory taste.



Irish Rutabagas(turnips) with Carmelized Onions

1. Heat Olive oil in a heavy skillet add the onions, cook over low heat
   for approximately 45 minutes or until they are golden and carmelized.
2. Meanwhile boil the rutabagas in salted water, cook until soft, drain

Herb Rub for Lamb

8   cloves   garlic
2   tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
2   tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves
2   tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

3   tablespoons olive oil

Finely chop/mince garlic, combine with other ingredients. Cut slits into lamb,
rub the herb mixture over the lamb and into the slits. Allow to sit at room
temperature for 1 hour before cooking.

Notes: Good - I didn't have time to let it sit on the lamb for an hour, so the
overall flavor impact was a bit less. I'd consider putting the rub on the
lamb and refrigerating it for a couple of hours/overnight.


Roast Leg of Lamb

1  leg of lamb (about 4lbs in weight)
   malt vinegar

1/4             cup olive oil
4               cloves garlic, minced
1               teaspoon lemons, zest of
1/2             teaspoon dried oregano
1/4             teaspoon red pepper flakes
                kosher salt (to taste)
                fresh ground black pepper (to taste)
1-2             tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley
3-4             ounces crumbled feta cheese
1               lemon (juice of, no seeds)

1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Heat olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, oregano, and red pepper flakes
in a small pan over low heat until garlic becomes golden and oil becomes
fragrant; remove from heat and allow to cool.
3. Bend asparagus gently until it breaks at a natural point and discard ends.
4. Toss asparagus pieces with infused olive oil and place in a single layer
on a baking sheet (one with a side edge).
5. Season asparagus with salt and pepper.
6. Sprinkle asparagus with crumbled feta cheese.
7. Roast at 400F for 12 minutes or until cooked to your liking.
8. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and squeeze the lemons over the asparagus,
being careful to catch the seeds.
9. Serve hot.

Notes: Wonderful! The tastes are complex, layered, and go together very
nicely. Be sure not to let the asparagus roast for too long; 8 minutes seemed
to be plenty when I made this dish.

tablespoon of the crabmeat imperial mixture. Place on a baking sheet and
sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake until warmed through and bubbly on top, 8
to 12 minutes.

If using the portobello mushrooms, with a paring knife, cut out the gills on
the underside of the mushrooms and discard. Lightly oil both sides with olive
oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and bake
until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and when cool enough to
handle, divide the crabmeat imperial mixture among the mushroom caps and
sprinkle with the cheese. Bake until the mixture is warmed through and bubbly
on top, 12 to 14 minutes.

Remove from the oven and place on a platter. Garnish with the fresh chives
and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4                    Wholemeal cottage loaf rolls
   1       lb           Small cap mushrooms
     1/4   pt           Double cream
   3       oz           Butter
   1       sm           Garlic clove
                        Fresh rosemary

  Cut the knobs off the rolls and reserve as lids.   Scoop out most of the
  crumb from the rolls, taking care not to pierce the crusts.  Crush the garlic
  with a pinch of salt, about 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary and a good
  grinding of black pepper.  Mash these flavourings into 2 1/2 oz butter and
  spread it thickly over the insides of the hollowed-out rolls.

  Season the cream generously with salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon fresh
  chopped rosemary and leave in a cool place to infuse.  Slice the mushrooms
  thickly, and heat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.

  Sit the rolls on a baking tray and put the lids beside them.  Bake for 10
  minutes until heated through and slightly crisp.  Meanwhile heat a large
  frying pan. Add 1/2 oz butter (don't be tempted to use more) and, when the
  foam dies down, saute the mushrooms. Cook them, stirring frequently, for 4-5
  minutes to reduce them and intensify their flavour.  Pour on the cream and
  let it bubble up for a few seconds.  Turn and stir the mushrooms for a
  minute or so until every slice is coated with the scant but richly flavoured
  sauce.

  Away from the heat, check and adjust seasoning.  Pile the creamy mixture into
  the freshly baked croustades, top with the lids and serve straight away with
  a large green (or tomato) salad on the side.

BARLEY AND ALMOND STUFFED SQUASH

   1       md           Acorn squash, or other winter squash
     1/3   c            Almonds -- chopped
   1       tb           Olive oil
   1 1/2   c            Onions -- chopped

   1       c            Barley -- cooked
   1       tb           Tamari

   Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and
membrane and place the squash cut-side down on a lightly oiled baking
dish. Bake at 350 degrees until the squash is still firm, but tender
enough to easily scoop out with a spoon, about 45 minutes.

   After the squash has been baking about 25 minutes, place
the chopped almonds in a pie tin or another small ovenproof container
and bake until they turna toasty light brown (10-15 minutes). Check
both the almonds and the sqash occasionally so you will know when
they are done.

   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and
the thyme. Saute over low heat until the onions are well done. Add the
cooked barley, tamari, and toasted almonds to the sauteed onions.

   Using a small spoon, scoop bite-sized chunks out of the
cooked squash, leaving enough flesh around the shell so that it
stays strong enough to hold its shape. Add the scooped out squash to the
barley mixture. Mix well. Fill the empty squash shells with this
mixture, mounding it as high as possible.

   Place the stuffed squash in a baking dish. Cover with
aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.

   4      large         green sweet peppers
   1      cup           reduced-sodium chicken broth
     3/4  cup           frozen florida orange juice concentrate -- thawed
	                    (Possibly reduce to 1/2 or 1/3 of a cup)
     1/2  cup           chopped onion
     1/2  cup           long grain rice
   2      teaspoons     chili powder
  15      ounces        black beans -- rinsed and drained
   1      11 ounces wh  kernel corn with sweet peppers -- drained
     3/4  cup           shredded reduced-fat monterey jack cheese
                        --3 ounces

Fill a Dutch oven about half full of water; bring to boiling, Halve peppers
lengthwise, removing seeds and membranes. Add peppers to boiling water-and
return to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes or-
until peppers are lust tender. Drain peppers.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan combine broth, thawed concentrate, onion,
uncooked rice, and chili powder. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and
simmer about 20 minutes or until rice is tender Stir in beans and corn,
Stir in most of the cheese.

Fill peppers with rice mixture. Place in a 3-quart rectangular baking dish.
Bake, covered, in a 400 degree oven about 25 minutes or until heated through.
Sprinkle with remaining cheese. 

Makes 4 servings (2 pepper-halves).

Notes: Very good; it takes a bit of work to get them together; one person
should parboil the peppers while the other handles the stuffing. Well worth
the effort required. The last time we made these I remember thinking we could
use less OJ - you only need enough to flavor the stuffing and 3/4 cup gives a
very strong orange flavor. (I may try a completely different flavoring, e.g. 
Southwest flavoring, salsa, etc.)

I often simplify the salsa by using 1 green onion, 1 small tomato, and 1/2 a fresh
jalapeno. I also tend to use fresh pineapple because it is much better.

Grilled Shrimp on the Barbie

      This recipe makes the same size appetizer serving that you get in the
restaurant. That's only 6 shrimp -- enough for me, but what are you guys
having? Thank goodness the remoulade sauce and the shrimp seasoning formulas
yield enough for more, so you can grill up to a pound of shrimp with this cool
clone.

Remoulade Sauce
3/4 cup mayonnaise
5 teaspoons stone ground mustard
4 teaspoons buttermilk
2 teaspoons minced celery
2 teaspoons minced green pepper
2 teaspoons minced onion
2 teaspoons sauerkraut
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
minced fresh parsley

Shrimp seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
dash allspice

6 large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound)
fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter, melted
minced fresh parsley

1. Preheat your grill to high heat.
2. Make the remoulade sauce by mixing the ingredients together in a small bowl.
   Cover and chill this sauce until you are ready to use it.
3. Prepare the shrimp seasoning by mixing the spices together in a small bowl.
4. Remove the shell from the shrimp. Keep the last segment of the shell and the
   tail. Remove the black vein that runs down the back of the shrimp. Stick a
   skewer through the middle of each shrimp. Push them together on the skewer
   so that they are "spooning" each other.
5. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the cuddling shrimp.
6. Brush melted butter generously over the top of the shrimp.
7. Sprinkle a bit of the seasoning on next. Don't use a heavy coating of
   seasoning
8. Place the shrimp onto your hot grill with the seasoning side down. Brush
   some more butter over the other side of the shrimp -- the flames should jump
   up from the butter. Sprinkle a light coating of seasoning over the shrimp
   (you should have lots of seasoning left over).
9. After 3 minutes or so the face-down side of the shrimp should be browned and
   showing some light charring. Flip the shrimp over and grill for an additional
   2-3 minutes or until browned on the other side.
10. Remove the shrimp from the grill and slide them off the skewer onto a slice
    of garlic butter coated bread.* Sprinkle with a pinch of fresh parsley.
Makes 1 to 2 servings.

*Tidbits
 It is best to use a clone for the Bushman bread. Just slice an inch-thick piece
 off through the middle of the bread. This will give you a slice that is about
 8 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide. Crush a clove of garlic and mix it with
 your left over melted butter. Brush this garlic butter on both sides of the
 bread and toast it until lightly brown. If you don't feel up to making the
 bread, you can use any bread you might have around that is in the shape of a
 hoagie roll. Or you may just wish to serve the shrimp on its own without the
 bread bed.

PICO DE GALLO - ROOSTER'S BEAK SALSA
 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Condiments
      Yield: 1 servings

      1 lb Diced Ripe Tomatoes
    1/2 c  Chopped White Onion
      1 c  Fresh Cilantro Leaves
      4 lg Fresh Serranos Or Jalapenos
           Chopped Fine, Seeds And All
    1/2 c  Ice Water
           Salt To Taste
           Fresh Lime Juice To Taste

  Mix all vegetables and herbs with the ice water, add
  salt and lime juice to taste.  Don't stir too much!
  This salsa is almost a relish and should be kept
  crisp, never mushy.  Good with everything.

  Notes: Reduce the amount of tomato added; as given the recipe ends up being
  more of a quick salsa than the pico de gallo I've seen at Mexican
  restaurants. The amount of kick can be influenced greatly by the addition
  or reduction of jalapenos; red chiles can be substituted for spice
  reduction.

Outback Steakhouse Steak Seasoning

It seems that everyone who digs flavorful, juicy cuts of beef wants to
know how to recreate the taste of Outback's famous steaks at home. If
that describes you, then I have good news, and even better news: This
recipe will do it, and it's real darn simple. Just throw together a few
spices and grab your top sirloin or rib eye or filet, and heat up a
large frying pan. That's right, folks. You don't need to preheat the
barbecue out back since Outback uses a flat indoor grill to get those
delicious results.

2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
dash coriander
dash turmeric

1. Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl.
2. To prepare steaks with this seasoning: Preheat a flat grill or large
frying pan over medium/high heat. Sprinkle some of the seasoning blend over
both sides of each cut of beef. Grill the steaks on each side to your desired
level of doneness. Be sure to use tongs to sear all the edges of each steak to
a rich brown color. (http://www.topsecretrecipes.com)

Tidbits
 For a gourmet variation, add couple tablespoons of red wine to the pan on
 high heat after removing the steak. Stir the wine around to remove the
 browned reside from the pan (deglaze it), and when the sauce has reduced by
 a third or so, pour it over your steak -- flavor bonanza!

Cream of Asparagus Soup

1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 (10 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth, defatted
1/4 cup white rice
1 pound asparagus spears
2 cups evaporated skim milk
1/2 cup fat-free sour cream

Lightly spray an unheated large saucepan with no-stick spray. Add the onions
and celery. Cook and stir over medium heat until the onions are tender. Stir
in the broth and rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat. Cover and simmer
about 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. 

Steam asparagus. Cut the tips from the asparagus and set aside. Chop the spears.
Add the spears and 1/2 cup of the milk to the rice mixture. Bring to a boil.

Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer the asparagus-rice mixture
to a blender or food processor. Blend or process until smooth. While the
blender or food processor is still running, slowly pour in the remaining 1 1/2
cups of milk. The final consistency should be smooth and slightly thickened.
Return the mixture to the saucepan. Heat the soup to a simmer. Remove from the
heat and stir in the sour cream. Garnish each serving with the reserved
asparagus tips. If desired, drizzle with additional fat-free sour cream
slightly thinned with water.

Notes: Good but needs another flavor element such as cheese, etc. to really bring
out the best flavor.



Apple-Glazed Barbecued Chicken

1 can (6 ounce) frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed
1/4 cup reduced-sodium ketchup
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon hot-pepper sauce
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (4 ounces each)

In a small saucepan, combine the apple juice concentrate, ketchup, brown
sugar, vinegar, thyme and hot- pepper sauce. Cook, stirring, over medium heat
until the sugar completely dissolves. Remove from the heat and cool to room
temperature. Place the chicken in a single layer in a 13-by-9-inch baking pan.
Pour about half of the cooled ketchup mixture over the chicken, turning once
to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate both the chicken and the remaining
ketchup mixture for 4 to 24 hours. Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Then
light the grill according the manufacturer's directions.

Check the temperature for grilling; the temperature should be medium-hot (see
the Test Kitchen Tip below). Place the rack on the grill. Remove the chicken
from the ketchup mixture; discard whatever ketchup mixture remains in the
baking pan. Coat the chicken pieces with nonstick spray and brush them with
some of the remaining ketchup mixture. Place the chicken on the rack and
grill, uncovered, for 8 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brush with the
remaining ketchup mixture. Grill for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is
tender and cooked through. Discard any remaining ketchup mixture.






HERB-ENCRUSTED ROAST LEG OF LAMB WITH GARLIC ROASTED BABY POTATOES

Recipe courtesy Emeril Lagasse, 2001

1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/2 cup dry red wine
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup minced fresh mint
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (6 pound) leg of lamb, trimmed of fat

3 pounds baby potatoes, rinsed well and halved (if larger than 1 1/2 inches in diameter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces)
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

In a bowl, whisk together the mustard, red wine and garlic. Slowly drizzle in
the olive oil to form an emulsion, then whisk in the herbs, salt and pepper.
Rub the mixture over the lamb, coating the outside completely. Place the lamb
in a large plastic bag and cover with any remaining marinade. Seal the bag,
refrigerate and let marinate at least 8 and up to 48 hours, turning the bag
occasionally to coat evenly.

In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining ingredients, turning to
coat evenly.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Place the lamb in a large roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes. Remove from
the oven and spread the potatoes evenly around the lamb. Return to the oven
and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
lamb registers 140 degrees F. for medium-rare, about 1 hour more. Remove the
lamb from the pan and place on a platter to rest for 15 minutes before
carving. Return the potatoes to the oven to continue cooking while the meat
rests.

Carve the lamb and serve with the hot roasted potatoes.

Notes: Excellent; well worth the expense of a leg of lamb and the fresh herbs.
This recipe produced some of the best roasted potatoes I've ever had.

Country Fried Steak With White Gravy

Recipe Courtesy Emeril Lagasse

1 cup vegetable oil
1 pound round steak, cut into 4 (4-ounce) pieces
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten
3 cups plus 3 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Heat the oil in a heavy 9-inch cast iron skillet, to 360
degrees F. Using a meat mallet, pound out the meat.
Season the steak with salt and pepper. Combine the egg
with 3 tablespoons of the milk. Put 1 1/2 cups of the
flour in a shallow pan and season with salt and pepper.
Dredge the steaks in the flour, coating each piece evenly
and tapping off any excess. Drip the steak in the egg
wash, coating it completely and letting the excess drip
off. Dredge again in the flour, shaking off any excess.
Fry the steaks in the hot oil, until golden brown on each
side, about 3 minutes. Remove and drain on paper
towels. Season with salt and pepper. Carefully pour off
the oil, leaving behind about 1/4 cup of the oil along with
the brown bits. Over medium heat, add the remaining 3
tablespoons flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, whisking
constantly. Add the remaining 3 cups milk, 1/2 cup at a
time, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, then reduce
the heat to medium-low. Season with salt and plenty of
pepper. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking constantly.
The gravy should be thick enough to coat the back of a
spoon. If it is too thick, add a little water to thin it.
Serve the fried steak and gravy with mashed potatoes
and green beans.

Classic Duck a L'Orange

Recipe courtesy Emeril Lagasse, 2001

2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice, from about 6
oranges
2 oranges, zested
2/3 cup sugar
1 (5-pound) Pekin duck, cleaned, with innards, wing tips
and excess fat removed
1 tablespoon bitters
2 cups duck or chicken stock
2 tablespoons arrowroot dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold
water
1 cup orange liqueur

Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.

Roughly chop the orange rinds after juicing and place in
the cleaned duck cavity. Place the stuffed duck on a
baking rack over a baking sheet with 1/2-inch of water.
Bake until skin turns golden brown and lightly crisps,
about 30 minutes. Reduce temperature to 300 degrees
and continue cooking until duck reaches an internal
temperature of 170 degrees, about 1 hour.

In a medium heavy saucepan combine the orange juice,
zest and sugar over medium high heat and reduce nearly
3/4 in volume, to about 3/4 cup. Add bitters to orange
juice gastrique, and set aside. Place duck stock in clean
saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add hot
stock to reduced orange gastrique, and continue to
simmer over medium low heat for 10 minutes to make
sauce.

Remove duck from roasting pan and discard drippings in
bottom of pan. Return duck to roasting pan and place pan
over 2 burners over medium high heat. Add orange
liqueur to pan and cook off the alcohol, scraping the pan
continuously with a large wooden spoon. Add 1 cup of the
orange sauce to the roasting pan and cook 1 minute.
Remove duck from the pan and discard orange rinds in
cavity. Place duck on serving platter and let sit 10
minutes before carving. Combine roasting pan juices and
orange sauce in a gravy boat and serve with carved duck.

Emeril's Kicked-Up Calzone al Forno  <not transcribed>

Recipe courtesy Emeril
Lagasse, 2001

Basic pizza dough, prepared
as described for calzones,
recipe follows
2 cups crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2/3 cup kalamata olives, pitted and coarsely chopped
1/2 pound mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus 1/2
pound mozzarella, sliced
1/2 pound ricotta
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
1 cup cooked sausage pieces, such as chorizo or Italian
sausage
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

Preheat oven to 500 degrees F and if you have one, place
a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine tomatoes, olive
oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Process until smooth
and transfer half of the sauce to a small bowl and set
aside. Divide remaining sauce between 4 calzones,
spreading the sauce on one half of the dough.

In a small bowl, combine olives, mozzarella cubes,
ricotta, Parmesan, sausage, and chopped basil and mix
well. Divide mixture between the 4 calzones, placing
cheese mixture on top of tomato sauce. Fold untopped
half of dough over filling, pressing edges together with
the tines of a fork.

Cut a slit in the top of each calzone and transfer calzones
to a preheated baking stone in a preheated oven and
cook for 8 minutes, or until golden brown and cheese is
bubbly on top. Remove from the oven with a metal peel
or spatula and serve immediately.

Basic pizza dough ? processor method:
1 package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F)
2 1/2 to 3 cups flour plus more if necessary
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

In a small bowl, combine yeast with water, olive oil, salt
and stir well to proof. After 5 minutes, transfer to the
bowl of a food processor along with flour, salt, and olive
oil and process until the dough forms a ball. The dough
should be soft but not sticky. If it is too sticky, add a bit
more flour and process for another minute.

Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and
knead dough for 2 to 3 minutes, adding enough
additional flour if necessary to form a smooth and elastic
dough. Dough should not be sticky. Transfer dough to a
lightly oiled 2 or 3 quart bowl and turn to coat dough with
oil. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place
until doubled in size, usually at least 1 hour.

For calzones, divide the dough into 4 equal portions and
form into 4 balls. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and
cover with a damp towel. Let rest for 15 minutes, then
transfer to a lightly floured surface and roll out into 4
(6-inch) circles.

Vegetable Curry [Miavita]

Ingredients

Cooking spray
1 - small onion, cut into small dice
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh garlic
4 teaspoons curry powder
1 - head cauliflower, cut into florets (4 cups)
6 - medium carrots, peeled and sliced
2 - medium baking potatoes, peeled and diced
2 1/2 cups (20 fl oz/600 ml) canned vegetable broth
1/4 teaspoon sea salt

Preparation - Estimated cooking time: 30-60 minutes -
1 Spray a large saucepan once with cooking spray and set over low heat. Add
  onions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, until translucent.
2 Add garlic and curry powder and cook, stirring, for 15 seconds.
3 Add cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, broth and salt. Cover and simmer until
  potatoes are soft, about 25 minutes.

Notes: This is very good! It results in perhaps a little too much broth for my
liking, which tends to dilute the curry flavor. As a result, I used a good bit
more curry powder than called for. Also, this makes a *lot* of vegetable
curry! Lastly, the potatoes can take forever to cook if added raw. I strongly
suggest parboiling them after dicing them, unless the pieces are very small.


Sweet and Sour Pork

1/2 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup water
4 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon sesame oil

1/2 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 cups cubed pineapple
Steamed white basmati rice, accompaniment
1/4 cup chopped toasted macadamia nuts, garnish
1/4 cup chopped green onions, garnish

In a bowl, combine the pineapple juice, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, water,

tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and garlic, and
cook, stirring, for 15 seconds. Add the pineapple juice mixture and bring to a
boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, 2 to 3
minutes.

In a bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the sherry. Add to the simmering sauce
and whisking constantly. Reduce the heat and simmer until thickened, 2 to 3
minutes. Remove from the heat.

Season the pork with the Essence. In a wok or large saute pan, heat 1
tablespoon of the oil over high heat, swirling to coat the sides. Add the pork
and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and drain on
paper towels.

Return the wok to high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, swirling to
coat the sides. Add the bell peppers and onions, and cook, stirring, until
wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add the sauce and
bring to a boil until thickened. Add the pineapple and pork, and cook,
stirring, until warmed through, 1 minute. Remove from the heat and adjust the
seasoning to taste. Divide the rice among 4 dinner plates, and top with the
pork and sauce. Garnish each with the nuts and green onions, and serve

The Cheesecake Factory Pumpkin Cheesecake

To celebrate the holiday, here's a great dessert - a clone for one delicious
selection from The Cheesecake Factory's menu of more than 40 cheesecakes. This
clone comes to the site from the book, "Top Secret Restaurant Recipes," and
this tasty creation will make a delicious finale to your Thanksgiving dinner
table this year. Use an 8-inch springform pan for this recipe, so that you
create a tall, creamy cheesecake that comes out just like the original you can
order at this great full service restaurant chain. Here's to an awesome,
belly-stuffing Thanksgiving!

1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
5 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup canned pumpkin
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon allspice
whipped cream

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Make the crust by combining the graham cracker crumbs with the melted
butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl. Stir well enough to coat all
of the crumbs with the butter, but not so much as to turn the mixture into
paste. Keep it crumbly.

3. Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up the
sides of the springform pan. You don't want the crust to form all of the way
up the back of each slice of cheesecake. Bake the crust for 5 minutes, then
set it aside until you are ready to fill it.

4. In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla.
Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.

5. Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue to beat
until smooth and creamy.

6. Pour the filling into the pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes. The top will
turn a bit darker at this point. Remove from the oven and allow the cheesecake
to cool.

7. When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the
refrigerator. When the cheesecake has chilled, remove the pan sides and cut
the cake into 8 equal pieces. Serve with a generous portion of whipped cream
on top.



Asparagus in Belgian Endive

24 asparagus spears
24 large outer Belgian endive leaves (2 or 3 heads)
1/4 c. olive oil
2 Tbs. white wine vinegar (I used red wine vinegar)
2 tsp. Dijon mustard
chopped parsley (I used dried)

For asparagus:  Snap off tough ends and lightly steam - tender crisp.
Separate endive leaves and place on serving plate. Place an asparagus spear on each leaf.  
Keep cold until serving time.
Make the dressing by mixing together the remaining ingredients. You can drizzle the dressing 
over the asparagus/endive just before serving or let
people do the drizzling themselves.

NOTES: A simple and elegent side dish. The asparagus is best if only lightly
steamed.

Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes

Salsa Verde
2 tomatillos, chopped (remove papery skin)
1 4-ounce can mild green chilies
1 green onion
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
1 1/4 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Southwestern Sauce
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon water
3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
dash salt
dash garlic powder

Tomato Salsa
1 medium tomato
1 tablespoon minced Spanish onion
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, minced
1/4 teaspoon lime juice
1/2 small fresh jalapeno, minced
dash salt
dash ground black pepper

Cakes
1 1/2 cups frozen sweet corn
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup corn masa (corn flour)
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Garnish
1/4 cup sour cream
1/2 avocado, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped [Passion for Cooking]

1. Prepare salsa verde by combining all ingredients (tomatillos, green
chilies, green onion, cilantro, sugar, cumin, salt, and pepper) in a food
processor on high speed. Cover and chill.

2. Prepare tomato salsa by combining all ingredients (diced tomato, onion,
cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno, salt, and pepper) in a small bowl. Cover and
chill.

3. Prepare southwestern sauce by combining all ingredients (mayonnaise,
vinegar, water, sugar, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, onion powder, salt, and
garlic powder) in a small bowl. Cover and chill.

4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

5. Prepare the tamale cakes by chopping 1 cup of the frozen corn in a food
processor until it's coarsely pureed. Combine pureed corn with softened
butter, sugar, and salt. Blend well with electric mixer until smooth.

6. Add masa and flour and blend well. Mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of frozen
corn kernels by hand.

7. Measure 1/2 cup portions of the mixture and form it into 3-inch wide
patties with your hands. arrange the patties on a baking sheet and bake for 25
to 30 minutes or until the cakes are browned on the bottom. Carefully flip all
cakes with a spatula and bake for an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until other
side is browned.

8. While the cakes are baking, spoon a portion of the salsa verde onto a
plate or platter (you may want to heat up your plate in the oven for a bit to
help warm the sauce). You'll need to use enough salsa verde to coat the entire
plate -- it should be about 1/4-inch deep. Arrange the tamale cakes
side-by-side on the salsa verde. Spoon a dollop of sour cream onto each tamale
cake. Drizzle the southwestern sauce over the cakes in a criss-cross patter
(use a squirt bottle if you've got one -- see "Tidbits"). Spoon some tomato
salsa over the cakes, followed by the chopped avocado.  Finish off the plate
by sprinkling the coarsely chopped cilantro leaves over the top.

Notes: I had these at the restaurant once, and they were really good. We
haven't tried making them yet - it looks to be quite a job! Rest assured,
though, that the end product is very tasty.

Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp

Curry Sauce
2 teaspoons chili oil
1/4 cup minced onion
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced ginger
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
3 cups coconut milk

2 medium carrots, julienned
1 small zucchini, julienned
1/2 cup frozen peas

Peanut Sauce
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
2 tablespoons water
4 teaspoons sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon lime juice
1/2 teaspoon chili oil

2 chicken breast fillets
16 large raw shrimp, shelled
1/4 cup corn starch
1/2 cup vegetable oil

4 cups cooked white rice

Garnish
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, crumbled
2 tablespoons chopped peanuts
2 green onions, julienned
[Passion for Cooking]

1. Make the curry sauce by heating the chili oil in a large saucepan over
medium heat. When the oil is hot add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Sauté for
about about 30 seconds then add the chicken broth. Add the spices (cumin,
coriander, paprika, salt, black pepper, and turmeric) and stir well. Simmer
for 5 minutes then add the coconut milk. Bring mixture back up to a boil, then
reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until sauce begins to thicken. Add
the julienned carrots and zucchini, and the frozen peas. Simmer mixture for 10
minutes or until carrots become tender.

2. Make peanut sauce by combining peanut butter, water, sugar, soy sauce,
rice vinegar, lime juice, and chili oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Heat just until mixture begins to bubble, then cover the pan and remove it
from the heat.

3. Toast the flaked coconut by preheating your oven to 300 degrees. Spread
coconut on a baking sheet and toast it in the oven. Stir the coconut around
every 10 minutes or so that it browns evenly, but watch it closely in the last
5 minutes so it doesn't get too dark. After 25 to 30 minutes the coconut
should be light brown. Take it out of the oven and let it cool.

4. Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces. Coat the chicken and shrimp
with corn starch. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium
heat. Add the coated chicken to the pan and sauté it for a couple minutes,
turning as it cooks. Add the shrimp to the pan. Cook the shrimp and chicken
for a couple minutes, until it's done, then remove everything to a rack or
towel to drain.

5. Build the two plates (or you can divide the meal into four portions) by
filling a soup bowl with 2 cups of white rice. Press down on the rice. Invert
the bowl onto the center of a plate, tap it a bit, then lift off the bowl
leaving a formed pile of rice in the center of each plate. Arrange an equal
portion of chicken and shrimp around the rice. Spoon the curry sauce and
vegetables over the chicken and shrimp, being careful not to get any sauce on
top of the rice.

6. Drizzle peanut sauce over the dish concentrating most of it on the rice.
Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of crumbled, dried parsley over the center of the rice.
Add a tablespoon of chopped peanuts on the parsley, then place a pile of
julienned green onions on top. Sprinkle 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of toasted coconut
over the chicken and shrimp and serve it up.

Makes 2 large entrees.



BRUSCHETTA DIP

Ingredients:
1/4 cup of olive oil
1 tablespoon of parsley
1 tablespoon of basil
2 large cloves of garlic, minced 
2 chopped Roma tomatoes (or a small can of diced tomatoes, drained)
1 medium onion, minced
4.5 ounces of Brie cheese (or Mozzarella)

Directions:
Throw all ingredients into a microwave safe bowl.  "Nuke" for about 2
minutes then stir.  Continue microwaving and stirring until everything is

Olive Garden Bruschetta al Pomodoro

4 medium tomatoes
6-8 fresh basil leaves, chopped
8 slices crusty bread
2-3 cloves garlic
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt (as needed)
Pepper (as needed)

Chop tomatoes, season with salt, pepper, chopped basil, and oil. Grill
bread, brush with garlic and top with tomatoes.

NOTES: This is a wonderful summer dish. It can be made with vine ripened
tomatoes from the supermarket, but only home-grown fresh tomatoes really do
the job well. The fresh basil is critical; I would not even attempt the dish
with dried basil. Also, get the best quality olive oil possible; this is one
dish where you'll be able to taste the difference.

Separate the slices, dip the slices into the milk, then into the flour. Fry
the breaded onions, a handful at a time in the oil until golden brown. Drain
on a paper towel.

3. When the soup has simmered for 10 minutes, strain the vegetables out of
the broth and toss them out. Pour the broth back into the pan and keep it hot
over low heat.

4. To serve soup, ladle about 1 cup of broth into a bowl. Drop a few pieces
of fried onion into the soup, followed by 6 to 8 mushroom slices (about 1

Shrimp and Snow Pea Soup (not transcribed)

Look for rice stick noodles at large supermarkets or any Asian grocery. Rice
vermicelli or fresh rice noodles can be substituted. When asparagus is in
season, it makes a wonderful addition to the soup. Trim 1 pound (480 g) thin
asparagus, cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces and add along with the snow peas.

12 ounces (360 g) medium shrimp, peeled
3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese seasoning wine)

3 ounces (90 g) Chinese rice stick noodles
4 ounces (120 g) fresh snow peas, trimmed and cut in half lengthwise
  (about 1 cup)

1 Using a sharp knife, slice shrimp along the back almost to other edge to
reveal the dark vein. Remove the vein and rinse shrimp. Place in a bowl and
toss with 2 tablespoons of the mirin, 1 tablespoon of the tamari, the minced
ginger and sesame oil. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

2 Combine cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the chicken broth; stir well and set
aside.

3 Thinly slice the green onions, keeping the white parts and green
parts separate.

4 Combine the remaining 4 1/2 cups (36 fl oz/1 liter) broth, 1
tablespoon mirin, 1 tablespoon tamari, ginger slices, and the sliced white
part of the onion in a large saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the
broth begins to boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.

sticks, shrimp and snow peas to the soup and return to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the cornstarch mixture
and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened. 6 Ladle the soup into
bowls and sprinkle each with minced green onion tops.

until onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add squash, 4 1/4 cups broth,
apple, and apple juice. Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered until
squash and apple are tender, about 30 minutes. Working in batches, puree soup
in blender until smooth. Return soup to pot. Season to taste with salt and
pepper.

Bring soup to simmer, thinning with more broth if desired. Ladle soup into
bowls. Garnish with sour cream and chives.

Makes 8 servings.

Notes: This is really good! We used an acorn squash and chicken stock as that's
what was on hand. The nutmeg adds good flavor without making the soup resemble
pumpkin pie too much. There is a nice balance between sweet and savory.

Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 40 min
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated fresh orange zest
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur
4 large eggs, separated
1/4 teaspoon salt
Confectioners sugar for dusting

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a 9
1/2-inch deep-dish glass pie plate.

Bring milk, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, cornstarch, and zest to a boil over
moderate heat in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, whisking constantly. Boil,
whisking, 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, juice, and liqueur
until butter is melted, then whisk in yolks until blended.

Beat whites with salt in a large bowl using an electric mixer at medium speed
until they just hold soft peaks. Add remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
a little at a time, beating, then beat until whites just hold stiff peaks.

Fold one fourth of whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in

BROCCOLI AND PARSNIP SOUP
Active time: 25 min Start to finish: 1 hr
1 lb broccoli
6 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
3 fresh parsley sprigs
3 fresh thyme sprigs or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled
1 Turkish or 1/2 California bay leaf
1/2 lb parsnips, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
1 cup chopped onion (1 medium)
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste

Special equipment: cheesecloth; kitchen string

Cut off and discard tough lower third of broccoli stems, then peel remaining
stem and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut remaining broccoli into
2-inch-wide florets.

Bring water to a boil in a 4-quart heavy pot, then add broccoli and 1
teaspoon salt and boil, uncovered, until broccoli is just tender, about 5
minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop
cooking, reserving cooking water in pot, then drain broccoli.

Wrap parsley, thyme, and bay leaf in a small square of cheesecloth and tie
into a bundle to make a bouquet garni. Add to reserved cooking water along
with parsnips, onion, and chicken broth and simmer, covered, until parsnips
are very tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

Discard bouquet garni and reserve 1 cup cooking liquid, then purée remaining
soup with broccoli, in batches if necessary, in a blender until smooth (use
caution when blending hot liquids). Transfer puréed soup to another pot and
thin to desired consistency with reserved cooking liquid. Stir in pepper,
nutmeg, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste) and bring to a simmer
over moderate heat, stirring occasionally.




STANDING RIB ROAST WITH ROSEMARY-THYME CRUST
An herb crust and special Zinfandel sauce give new meaning to the word
flavorful. What to drink: A full-bodied, tannin-rich Bordeaux or Cabernet
Sauvignon.

1 9- to 9 1/2-pound standing beef rib roast (about 4 ribs), all but
thin layer of fat trimmed
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
32 fresh baby carrots, green tops trimmed to 1 inch, peeled
16 large shallots, peeled

3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all purpose flour
3 1/2 cups Zinfandel Beef Stock

Place beef, fat side up, in large shallow roasting pan or on rimmed baking
sheet. Sprinkle beef all over with salt and pepper. Spread mustard all over
beef. Mix rosemary and thyme in small bowl; sprinkle over beef and press
lightly to adhere. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

Position rack just below center of oven and preheat to 450°F. Roast beef
uncovered 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Roast beef 1 hour 30
minutes. Remove from oven. Spoon off all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Add
carrots and shallots to pan. Turn vegetables to coat with drippings; sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Roast beef and vegetables until thermometer inserted
into center of beef registers 125°F for medium-rare, stirring vegetables
occasionally, about 55 minutes longer. Transfer beef and vegetables to
platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm.

Discard drippings from roasting pan. Place pan over 2 burners on stove top
over medium heat. Add butter to pan and melt. Add flour; whisk until smooth
and just beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Whisk in stock. Boil until sauce
thickens slightly, whisking often, about 10 minutes. Season sauce to taste
with salt and pepper. Serve beef with vegetables and sauce.


ZINFANDEL BEEF STOCK
It's worth the extra effort to make this rich stock; the slow-simmered taste
produces a sauce that far exceeds any made with canned beef broth. This recipe
is an accompaniment for Standing Rib Roast with Rosemary-Thyme Crust.

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 1/2 to 4 pounds meaty beef bones (such as neck bones, beef back ribs, or
crosscut beef shank)
2 cups chopped onions
2/3 cup chopped carrots
2/3 cup chopped celery
3 quarts cold water
1 cup Zinfandel or other hearty red wine
4 large fresh thyme sprigs
3 large fresh parsley sprigs
1/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns

Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add beef bones; sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Sauté until deep brown, turning occasionally, about 15
minutes. Using tongs, transfer bones to bowl. Add onions, carrots, and celery
to pot. Sauté until deep brown, about 10 minutes. Return bones and any juices
to pot. Add 3 quarts cold water, wine, and next 3 ingredients. Bring to boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to 3 1/2 cups liquid, about
3 hours. Strain stock into bowl. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, at least 4
hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled.) Spoon off fat before
using stock.

Makes about 3 1/2 cups.

Chicken and Dumplings
Recipe courtesy Gourmet Magazine


 Recipe Summary
 Prep Time: 15 minutes  Cook Time: 1 hour
 Yield: 6 servings
1 (3-pound) chicken, cut into parts
1 cup all-purpose flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 leeks (white and pale green parts only,) sliced thin crosswise and washed thoroughly
(about 1 1/2 cups)
4 shallots, sliced thin (about 3/4 cup)
4 carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise, and sliced
2 celery ribs with leaves, sliced
1 small bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled

1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons fresh dill, minced
1 cup plus 3 tablespoons half-and-half


Dredge chicken parts in seasoned flour, shaking off excess, and put on a

blended. With a large soup spoon scoop out 12 dumplings and arrange over
chicken mixture. Simmer chicken and dumplings, covered, 12 minutes. (Dumplings
are done when a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.) Discard bay
leaf. Serve with a green salad.



Knocks and Chops;
knockwurst with Spiced Sauerkraut AND Smoked Pork Chops with Bacon, Apple and Onion
Recipe courtesy Rachael Ray

Knocks:
1 (16-ounce) package (4 links) knockwurst
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound sauerkraut, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorns
1 cup dark German beer
Spicy mustard
1 loaf pumpernickel, sliced

Chops:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
3 slices bacon, chopped
1 medium to large yellow onion, quartered then thinly sliced
1 green apple, cored and thinly sliced
6 thin cut boneless smoked pork chops, halved on an angle, available near
  packaged ham in meat case
1 cup dark German beer

Accompaniments:
1/2 pound each of 2 cheese selections such as: beer kaese, bruder basil, muenster
Sour pickles
1 bag Bavarian pretzels


Pierce the casings of knockwurst and arrange in medium skillet. Add 1 inch of
water, bring to a simmer and warm wursts through. Remove from the pan. Drain
the skillet and add butter. Melt butter over medium heat. Cut each knockwurst
into 1/3 and add back to the pan to crisp casings. Add sauerkraut to the pan,
sprinkle in caraway, add bay leaf and peppercorns. Pour the beer into the
skillet. When the beer comes to a bubble reduce heat to simmer.

Heat a second skillet over medium high. Add oil, 1 turn of the pan and add
chopped bacon. When the bacon renders its fat, add onions and saute 3 to 5
minutes, then add sliced apples and saute mixture another 2 or 3 minutes. Add
smoked chops to the pan and caramelize meat on both sides, 2 or 3 minutes.
Remove chops to a plate and loosely cover with foil. Pour the beer into the
pan and reduce heat to a simmer.

When you are ready to serve, cut several slices of pumpernickel in half down
the middle. Place a bowl of spicy mustard alongside the pumpernickel bread for
passing at the table.

Place 2 or 3 chunks of the knockwurst on each dinner plate on a bed of spiced
sauerkraut. Serve 3 pieces of smoked pork chops topped with bacon, apples and
onions. Place deli style large dill or half sour pickles, German cheeses and
pretzels out for an evening of uber snacking!


Parsley-Dill Potatoes
Recipe courtesy Rachael Ray

2 1/2 pounds medium to large red potatoes
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves
1/4 cup chopped dill
Salt and pepper

Using a peeler or a paring knife, peel a 1/2-inch strip around the
circumference of each potato. Fill a large saucepan with cold water. Add the
potatoes and place them over high heat. Boil potatoes until fork tender, about
15 to 20 minutes. Drain and place the potatoes back into the pan on the burner
for 30 seconds to dry them out. Add the butter and toss in the herbs. Season
the potatoes with salt and pepper.

Notes: This whole meal comes together very nicely. The knockwursts and
sauerkraut contrast very nicely with the smoked chops in the apples and
onions. The potatoes are also quite good, but are the weakest link in the
entire meal. I'd probably opt to serve a nice pumpernickel and/or rye bread in
the potatoe's place. With a nice cheese or two, and some other nice sides like
spiced apple rings and pickles, the potatoes would never be missed!

Alaskan Salmon Chowder *

1/2   cup onions, chopped
1/2   cup celery, chopped
1/4   cup green peppers, chopped
1   clove garlic, minced
1 (14.5    ounces) can chicken broth, divided
2   cups peeled potatoes
1   cup carrot, sliced
1   teaspoon seasoning salt (optional)
1/2   teaspoon dill weed
1   small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 (14.75    ounces) can cream-style corn
1 (12    fluid ounces) can evaporated milk
2   cups cooked salmon or 2 (7.5 ounces) cans salmon, drained and bones removed

1. In a saucepan, cook onion, celery, green pepper and garlic in 1/4 cup broth
   until tender.
2. Add potatoes, carrots, seasoned salt if desired, dill and remaining broth.
3. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
4. Add zucchini; simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Add corn, milk and salmon; heat through.

Notes: An excellent winter soup. I used fresh salmon, and highly recommend it
over the canned salmon. We will definitely be having this soup again.
Further note: The flavor of this soup is slightly subtle, and the creamed corn
and evaporated milk combine very well. I'd consider this a comfort food. The
presence of the zucchini adds some color to an otherwise mostly white soup.
Everybody we've offered this soup to has liked it so far.

MOROCCAN CHICKEN WITH EGGPLANT, TOMATOES, AND ALMONDS


This version of a tagine, the classic Moroccan stew, calls for dark meat
because it stays moist when braised. If you prefer white meat, reduce the

6 large garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon Hungarian sweet paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt
1 teaspoon turmeric

sauce over. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15
minutes. Turn chicken over, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender, about
20 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F. Brush large rimmed baking sheet with olive
oil. Place eggplant and remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in large bowl; toss

Top Secret Recipes Boston Market Butternut Squash

Here's a great way to make butternut squash, that's easy and quick. Most of
your time will be spent cutting the squash into 1-inch cubes. After that, it's
just a simple matter of steaming the squash, then getting in there to mash it
up. Mix in the other ingredients and you've got a great side that fits right
in with many meals, especially spicy dishes.

1 medium butternut squash
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

1. Cut squash into quarters. Remove the seeds and slice off the skin, then
chop the squash into 1-inch cubes. Put squash in a steamer rack in a large
saucepan over boiling water and cover. Steam for 30 minutes or until the
squash is tender.

2. When squash has cooked, use a potato masher to mash squash until smooth in
a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients and continue mashing until everything
is mixed in. Let the squash sit for at least 10 minutes so that the flavors
can develop. Reheat in the microwave for a minute or so before serving.

Notes: Very good! This makes for a sweet side dish, which will go well with
a spicy main dish, or something that simply complements the natural sweetness
of the squash (poultry maybe).



Asian Eggdrop Soup  #22163 (transcribed)

4 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon cornstarch, mixed with 2 t water
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 green onions, chopped (the whole onion)
salt and pepper

1. Bring broth and soy sauce to a boil.
2. Slowly add cornstarch mix, stirring until thickened.
3. Reduce to a simmer.
4. Add eggs slowly, while stirring the soup in the same direction.
5. The egg will spread and feather.
6. Turn off heat and add the onions.
7. Add salt and pepper.
8. Serve at once.

Notes: Excellent and very easy to make. You could probably use 5 cups of broth
without noticing the difference. One time when I made this soup we only had
one small can of chicken broth, so I rounded out the difference with vegetable
broth. The flavor was slightly different, but the soup was still just as good.
Further note: I continue to make this soup - every time I do Kate and I both
remark on how good it is. It's simple and it comes together very quickly.
It's a great comfort soup for cooler days, and we usually have the ingredients
on hand.
I don't really even measure anymore. Some broth, a few dashes of soy sauce,
a couple of eggs. Very easy.


Waldorf Salad

A crunchy, sweet and hearty salad of apples, celery, nuts and mayonnaise.
This salad can easily become a summer luncheon main dish by adding cooked,
diced chicken. You will probably need to add a little more mayonnaise. Another
nice variation is halved grapes in addition to the apples, or pears as a
replacement for the apples.

4       medium apples, washed and diced
1/2     teaspoon brown sugar
1       tablespoon lemon juice
1       cup celery, chopped
1/2     cup pecans or walnuts
2/3     cup mayonnaise

1. Wash, core and dice unpeeled apples.
2. Sprinkle lemon juice over them and toss together gently to coat, then
   sprinkle brown sugar over the apples and toss again.
3. Chill for at least 20 minutes.
4. Add celery and nuts then stir in mayonnaise, adding only enough for
   desired consistency.
5. Serve on a bed of greens.

Notes: Yep, it's Waldorf salad. :) I liked the little bit of extra sweetness
the brown sugar added. I hadn't heard of that before - it's a good addition.
Skip measuring out the mayo - just add enough to barely cover the apples and
celery (unless you're a mayonnaise lover, in which case you should probably
make your own bowl of waldorf salad). As with other mayo-covered salads, start
with way too little mayo and then add tiny amounts more as you mix - it's easy
to suddenly overwhelm the other food.


Eggplant Curry with Toasted Almonds

1 1/2 cups jasmine rice, cooked to directions on package
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large, firm eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large, yellow skinned onion, peeled and chopped
1 large red bell pepper, seeded and diced
4 cloves garlic, cracked
1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup (a couple of heaping tablespoons) mango chutney
1 rounded tablespoon mild curry paste or 2 tablespoons curry powder
Coarse salt
1 cup vegetable broth or stock
A handful (about 2 tablespoons) cilantro leaves, finely chopped, optional

Garnishes:
Toasted sliced or slivered almonds
Thinly sliced scallions or chopped fresh chives

Prepare rice. While rice is simmering, start curry.

Heat a deep, heavy bottomed nonstick skillet over medium to medium high heat.
When the pan is hot, add oil, eggplant, onion, and bell pepper. Cover pan and
cook 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover and add garlic; cook 1
minute more. Add tomatoes, chutney, curry, salt, and broth. Stir to combine
and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes over low heat for flavors to combine. Remove
curry from heat and stir in cilantro. Ladle eggplant curry into shallow bowls.
Using an ice cream scoop, scoop rice balls into the center of bowls. Garnish
your the and rice with lots of toasted sliced almonds and scallions or chives.
Tidbits: Curry paste is available on the International Foods aisle of markets.
The paste is deep red in color and will keep several months in the
refrigerator.

Notes: This is quite good, but I'm going to need to tinker with it before I'm
going to be happy with the recipe.

  First, I'd make sure I cooked the eggplant and vegetable mixture for the
  full 8 minutes before adding the garlic.

  Secondly, I'd probably simmer after I've added the broth and tomatoes for
  more like 3-5 minutes, or until the eggplant is completely done. Maybe I
  just like my eggplant more well-done than some people, but I found that any
  eggplant pieces that hadn't been cooked during the first step didn't finish
  cooking during the simmering.

  Next, I made the mistake of using red curry paste. This made the entire pan
  of curry a majorly hot and spicy affair; too hot for Kate to eat at all. I
  added some curry powder to bring it back to the Indian side of things (the
  red curry paste being a Thai cooking ingredient), and added some plain
  yogurt, but it was still too hot for Kate. So, next time either use yellow
  curry paste, or just use good old curry powder. (Or add *very small* amounts
  of red curry paste successively, keeping in mind that it is very easy to
  flame out the entire dish.)

  The sliced almonds are ok as a topper; I think green onions (didn't get time
  to slice any) would have been better.






Spicy Hummus

1 (14.5 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
2 rounded tablespoons tahini sesame paste
A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon crushed pepper flakes
1 teaspoon (1/3 palmful) ground cumin
1 teaspoon (1/3 palmful) ground coriander
1 clove garlic, crushed
Coarse salt
1/2 lemon, juiced
Pita breads, grilled and cut into wedges for dipping

Combine beans, tahini, oil, pepper flakes, cumin, coriander, garlic, salt,
and lemon juice in food processor bowl and grind into a smooth paste. Transfer
to a small dip dish and surround spread with warm pita wedges. This recipe
makes a great appetizer, or anytime snack.

Tidbit: this is a fantastic dish to take to a pot luck or block party -- it's
always a hit!

Notes: Yum! The hummus ends up being pretty thick, so you'll either add way
more than a drizzle of olive oil, or a bit more lemon juice. The tahini we
used was pretty thick; maybe that contributed. Anyway, the thickness of the
hummus didn't do anything bad to the flavor, which was top-notch.

CARDAMOM APPLE ALMOND CAKE

Because the cornstarch in confectioners sugar isn't kosher for Passover, we
powdered granulated sugar in an electric coffee/spice grinder and mixed it
with potato starch for a similar effect.

For cake
Vegetable oil for greasing pan
1/2 cup matzo meal (not cake meal), plus additional for dusting
1 cup slivered almonds (4 1/2 oz), toasted and cooled
1/2 teaspoon salt
Scant 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
5 large eggs, separated, at room temperature for 30 minutes
1 cup granulated sugar
2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and coarsely grated
Powdered Sugar

Special equipment: a 9- to 9 1/2-inch (24-cm) springform pan; an electric
coffee/spice grinder

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Oil springform
pan and dust with matzo meal, knocking out excess.

Pulse almonds in a food processor with 1/2 cup matzo meal, 1/4 teaspoon salt,
and cardamom until finely ground. (Be careful not to pulse to a paste.)

Beat yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until
smooth, then add 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating, and beat
until mixture is very thick and pale, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in nut mixture,
then apples. Beat whites and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in another bowl with
cleaned beaters at medium speed until they hold soft peaks. Add remaining 1/4
cup sugar, a little at a time, beating, and beat until whites just hold stiff
peaks. Stir one fourth of whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in
remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Scrape batter into pan and rap pan
once on work surface to eliminate any large air bubbles.

Bake cake until puffed, browned, and top springs back when touched, 40 to 45
minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely in pan (cake will sink
slightly in center). Run a knife around edge of cake to loosen, then remove
side of pan.

Sift some powdered sugar over cake before serving.



Pesto  #13044 *

All purpose pesto sauce

4 	tablespoons pine nuts
2 	cloves garlic
1/2 	teaspoon salt
2 	cups fresh basil
5 	tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
1/2 	cup olive oil

1. Lightly toast pine nuts.
2. In a food processor (or with a pestle and mortar), mix the basil, garlic,
   pine nuts and cheese into a paste.
3. Add oil and blend to a smooth paste.
4. Keep in an airtight jar in the fridge.



Bahama Mamma  #37208 *

This is a coctail that we tried in the Bahamas but be careful because it
tastes so fruity that you forget how much you've had to drink!!!

1 	ounce jamaican white rum
1 	ounce bacardi rum
1 	ounce coconut rum
1 	ounce nassau royale (optional)
4 	ounces pineapple juice
2 	ounces lemon juice
1/2 ounce grenadine

1. Mix all ingredients and shake well.
2. Into a highball glass, pour over ice.
3. Serve with a slice of orange, pineapple and/or cherry.

Notes: I believe that the bacardi rum should be dark rum, and we could
probably substitute any orange liquor for the nassau royale.
Don't drink one of these if you have to drive in the next hour. They are
quite potent. We had the best luck using triple sec as a substitute for the
nassau royale

Banana Peppers Stuffed with Saurkraut  #66905

The peppers, saurkraut and sugar combine to make a spicy/sour/sweet mixture.
We eat these like pickles or with meals. I also give them as Christmas gifts.
This is an old recipe given to me by my ex-grandmother-in-law.

3 cups vinegar
2 cups water
2 lbs sugar
3 quarts banana peppers (hot or sweet)
1 bag sauerkraut

Makes 3 Quarts
1 hour 30 mins prep

1. Mix vinegar, water and sugar.
2. Boil 15 minutes.
3. Cut off stem end of peppers and seed (wear rubber gloves).
4. Stuff peppers with saurkraut and put into pint or quart jars very tightly.
5. Pour brine overtop.
6. Seal jars.

May need as little as 1 cup of sugar to avoid excessive sweetness




Stuffed Banana Peppers  #20849

In response to a request. Hope you like stuffed peppers....they are yummy

8 	banana peppers
2 	tablespoons butter
1/2 	cup onions, chopped
1/2 	cup celery, chopped
1 (28 	ounces) can crushed tomatoes
1 (8 	ounces) can tomato sauce
2 	cloves garlic, minced
1 	teaspoon dried basil
1 	teaspoon dried oregano
2 1/2 	teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 	teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 	egg
1 	teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 	cup grated parmesan cheese
1 	lb hot Italian sausage
1 	lb mild Italian sausage
1 1/2 	cups breadcrumbs

8 servings

1. Cut off tops of peppers, and remove stuff inside& seeds.
2. Chop edible portions of tops; set aside.
3. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
4. Add peppers, reduce heat, and simmer until tender but still firm, about 5
   minutes.
5. Drain and set aside.
6. Heat butter in a medium skillet.
7. Saute reserved chopped pepper, onion and celery until tender, 3 to 5
   minutes.
8. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and garlic.
9. Season with basil, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
10. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 350F In a large mixing bowl, combine egg, 1 teaspoon
    salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, Worcestershire sauce and Parmesan.
12. Mix in hot sausage, mild sausage, bread crumbs and 1 cup of the tomato
    sauce mixture.
13. Using a piping bag or spoon, fill each pepper with the meat mixture.
14. Place in a 3 quart casserole dish, and pour remaining tomato sauce
    mixture over peppers.
15. Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 1 hour.

Notes: Ok, banana peppers are just a pain in the ass to stuff; there's no
getting around that. You would do well to only use your widest banana peppers
for this, so it would be easier to stuff them. The problem is, most banana
peppers have a flat section where the opposing walls of the pepper nearly
touch - this makes it difficult to avoid splitting the blanched peppers. Plus,
they don't hold a lot of stuffing, so you're going to be using a good number.
I'm not saying you should avoid stuffing banana peppers entirely, but I think
the path to sanity with this recipe is to use more than one kind of pepper
for stuffing. A few bell peppers, a few banana peppers, maybe a few other
kinds; that will keep you from doing too much work (otherwise everybody will
need about 4 stuffed peppers each!).


Sweet Pickled Banana Peppers  #17254 *

I love these peppers on hot dogs, hamburgers or what ever. They are so easy
to make. You can double the recipe with no problem. I have never water bathed
these pickles the jars have always sealed securely and I have used them a year
or so later, Just be sure that the top has sealed and you have heard it POP.
If the jar does not seal fully store in the fridge and use within a couple of
months. As you can see from the picture I often mix hot Jalapeno, Anaheim,
Banana and any other peppers on hand - the result is medium hot pickled
peppers.

1/2 	lb banana peppers, seeded and slicded across,so you have rings
Pickling Juice
2 	cups white vinegar
2/3 	cup white sugar
1/2 	teaspoon mustard seeds
1/2 	teaspoon celery seeds
2 1/2 pint jars Change size or US/metric

35 minutes 25 mins prep

1. Sterilize 2- 1/2 pint jars.
2. Bring the vinegar, sugar, mustard seed and celery seed to a rolling boil.
3. Place peppers in the 1/2 pint jars.
4. Pour on the pickling juice.
5. Bring brine to within 1/2" of the top.
6. Be sure the edge of the jar has no juice on it.
7. Seal jar and leave for 2 weeks.

Notes: These are really good! You could probably cut down on the sugar just a
little bit, but you don't want the pickles to be too tart. So far I think
everybody who has tried these has liked them.

Garden Fresh Three Bean Salad  #36698

This a German recipe that I adapted from Schoener Essen magazine, directly
from the German. This three bean salad is served slightly warm and calls for
fresh from the garden beans rather than canned. It is a nice change of pace if
you enjoy 3-bean salads and want to try something new. Simply click on the
"convert recipe to US" to swtich from metric to US measurements. Enjoy!

1 pound fresh green beans, cut into 1" pieces
1 pound fresh yellow wax beans, cut into 1" pieces
salt and pepper, to taste
1 pound lima beans (fresh or frozen,thawed)
2 small red onions, slivered
sugar, to taste
1-2 clove fresh garlic, minced
3/8 cup fresh lemon juice
5/8 cup olive oil
1 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped

8 servings
25 minutes 10 mins prep

1. Boil green and yellow beans together in salted water for about 10-12 miutes.
2. Add the lima beans and cook another 2 minutes.
3. Drain and set in a serving bowl.
4. Whisk together salt, pepper, a pinch of sugar, olive oil, onions,garlic,
   lemon juice, and parsley.

Microwave Bread & Butter Pickles  #3397 (transcribed)

2 	cups cucumbers, sliced, thin
3/4 	cup onions, thin sliced
1 	cup sugar
1/2 	cup white distilled vinegar
1 	teaspoon salt
1/2 	teaspoon mustard seeds
1/4 	teaspoon celery seeds
1/4 	teaspoon turmeric

1. Mix all in a 2 qt. bowl (microwavable) and microwave on High 8 to 9
minutes stirring twice during cooking time. Cukes will be crisp, onions
translucent. My mom has a small microwave that is not very powerful so she had
to microwave hers a little longer.

Note from other cook: The first time I made these we felt that they were too
sweet so then I tweeked the recipe and ended up with a pickle that we now love
and the recipe is so quick and easy to follow. I use only 1/4 cup of sugar,
1/2 tsp. salt and 2 small cloves of fresh garlic minced. I keep everything
else the same.

Notes: These are really good! Definitely cut waay back on the sugar. You can
probably use a heaping 1/4 cup, but there's no way I'd want an entire cup of
sugar. Once you have the sliced cucumbers and onion things go together very
quickly.


Lynn's Famous Gazpacho  #41218 *

2 medium cucumbers, peeled & diced
2 lbs ripe tomatoes, chopped (6 large)
1/2 medium red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
3 carrots, coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt
pepper
celery salt or garlic salt
red pepper flakes
1/2 cup water

Garnish:
 avocados
 radishes
 cilantro
 1/4 cup red onions, thinly sliced
 6 tablespoons yogurt or sour cream (optional)

6 servings
30 minutes 30 mins prep

1. In a blender or very large food processor puree the tomatoes, red pepper,
   garlic, carrots, lemon juice, spices, olive oil, and 1/2 of the cucumber
   chunks and a 1/2 cup of water.
2. Pour into a large bowl or tupperware container, stir in the remainder of
   the diced cucumber.
3. Cover and chill overnight or for at least three hours.
4. To serve, garnish soup with onion, avocado, cilantro, radishes, etc.

Notes: Very good - definitely let it chill overnight. Produces a very
fresh-tasting and refreshing summer soup. I found the addition of sour cream
to the individual servings critical, and also added some chili sauce to my
individual serving. Really, there's nothing to tweak here - I could see maybe
adding an additional clove or two of garlic but other than that leave it be.

Legal Seafoods Baked Scallops  #86307 *

different ways to top the casserole; skip the butter, bake for a while, add
some parmessan...or add half the butter and finish with he broiler. Goes
together quickly and is well worth making again.

penne pasta with asparagus sauce  #55679 *

this is an absolutely fabulous pasta side dish i created to go along with my
scallops in white wine sauce. it really highlights the scallops. hope you
enjoy!!

1 	lb fresh asparagus
1 	tablespoon fineley grated lemons, zest of
1/4 	cup olive oil
1 	lb penne pasta
3/4 	cup grated parmasean-reggiano cheese
2 	tablespoons fresh finely chopped parsley

1. cut the asparagus into one inch pieces; reserving the tips.
2. cook asparagus in 5 quarts of water until very tender 6-8 minutes.
3. reserve the water by using a slotted spoon to remove the asparagus to a
   colinder.
4. put the drained asparagus in a food processor.
5. cook the tips for 3-5 minutes until just tender.
6. remove from water with slotted spoon, reserving the water.
7. puree the stems with the lemon zest and oil and 1/2 cup of the asparagus
   water.

Notes: Very good! The flavor of the sauce is considerably more delicate than I
had expected. The lemon zest nearly overpowered the asparagus - be careful not
to add too much. The fibers from the asparagus didn't get chopped up by the
immersion blender we have - next time I'd just chop the spears before boiling.

neutral flavor, they could go with just about anything. I think they'd be good
at breakfast as well as for dinner. We put a bit of sour cream on ours - it

Top Secret Recipes version of
Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Dark Chocolate Cake Mix

Lets say you want to make some chocolate cake -- like the popular mixes that
come in a box -- but you dont have much of a craving for propylene glycol
mono- and diesters of fats, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, cellulose gum,
mono-and diglycerides or xanthan gum. Well, if youre making cake from a box
mix, thats what youll be eating. Many of those additives are what give the
cake you make with Duncan Hines cake mix its deluxe moistness. The good news
is we can come very close to duplicating the store-bought cake mix with very
simple dry ingredients and a little shortening. By combining the dry stuff,
then thoroughly mixing in the shortening, you will have a mix that is
shelf-stable until you add the same wet ingredients in the same amounts
required by the real stuff. Its a great way to make good, old-fashioned
chocolate cake without the hard-to-pronounce additives. Plus, this mix is the
same stuff required for the Oreo cookie clone here on the site. If you cant
track down the cake mix for that recipe, you now can make it from scratch.

2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups bakers sugar (superfine sugar)
3/4 cup cocoa
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
4 tablespoons shortening

To make cake
1 1/3 cups water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 large eggs

1. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
  large bowl. Stir to combine. Add shortening, then use an electric mixer on
  medium speed to blend shortening into dry ingredients. Mix until no chunks of
  shortening are visible. This is your cake mix, which you can keep in a sealed
 container for several months until you are ready to make the cake.
2. To make the cake preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the sides and
  bottom of two 9-inch baking pans or one 13x9-inch pan. Lightly flour the
  greased pans.
3. Blend dry cake mix (from step #1) with water, oil and eggs in a large bowl
  with an electric mixer at low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium
 and beat for 2 more minutes.
4. Pour batter into pans and bake for 30 to 33 minutes for 9-inch pans, and
  35 to 38 minutes for 13x9-inch pan. You can also make cupcakes with the mix.
  They take 19 to 22 minutes.

All American County Fair Prize Winning Chili  #57204

After my five roomates and I have this for dinner I am still left with about
30 to 40 individual servings in the freezer. This chili freezes perfectly. I
make this up once every 6 months and the last bag tastes just as good as the
day I made it! Before sharing this recipe I had to think long and hard because
it truely is my most prized and coveted recipe. It took me years of playing
around and it's just near perfect. If you win at the county fair all I ask for
is honorable mention, a picture of the ribbon, a postcard from your town, and
maybe your favorite pie recipe! Be sure to load it up with cheddar, sour
cream, bread and nacho chips!! Also great for chili dogs!!

1 	can tomatoes
1 	can tomato sauce
2 	cans tomato paste
	water
1 	medium onion, chopped
3-5 	cloves garlic, minced
4-5 	stalks celery, chopped
1 	green pepper, chopped
1 	sweet red pepper, chopped
5 	chili peppers, whole (cut slits lengthwise)
5 	jalapeno peppers, whole (cut slits lengthwise)
1 	zucchini, chopped
1 	eggplant, chopped
1 	bag baby carrots (whole)
	mushrooms (whole)
1 	bag frozen corn
	steak, diced (any cut)
	ground meat (any, I like to use chicken)
	dark red kidney beans, cooked
	black turtle beans, cooked
	lentils, cooked
1 	pinch oregano
	basil, to taste
1/4-1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 	teaspoon cinnamon
	black pepper
2 	tablespoons cocoa powder

1. Put all ingrediants in a pot and cook for 5 to 10 hours.
2. Stir occasionally.
3. The ingredients list is enough to make 2 pots worth (dutch oven size).
4. I usually omit the meat from one pot and make a vegetarian batch at the
same time.
5. It's good for your vegan friends and as lighter fare for lunch!
6. Put the chile and jalapeno peppers in last with their stems sticking up
out of the chili.
7. This makes them easy to remove for those who don't want their chili hot!

Notes: I can see this recipe is going to take some tinkering, but it sure
looks interesting...
Ok - I'm making this now and can already say that we like/need some chili
powder added to these igredients. The above mixture, while a very interesting
and good mixture, just doesn't identify itself as chili to us. Maybe our
tastes aren't very sophisticated, but once I added a few tablespoons of chili
powder, it really seemed to come together. I left out a few ingredients this
first time (mushrooms and lentils), but added as much of the rest as possible.
It's good, very good. I'll need to tinker some more before I have a final
opinion on this chili vs. the simple and quick chili I'm used to making. It
does take quite a while to get all the ingredients together; it's not
something you can make after you get home from work by any means.

Soup Nazi's Mulligatawny Soup

4 quarts water
6 cups chicken stock
2 potatoes, peeled and diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
2 stalks celery with tops, diced
2 cups peeled and diced eggplant
1 med onion, chopped
1 cup frozen yellow corn
2/3 cup canned roasted red peppers, diced
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1/2 cup shelled pistachios
1/2 cup roasted cashews
1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup butter
3 T sugar
1/2 tsp curry powder
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp thyme
1 bay leaf
dash marjoram
dash nutmeg

Combine all ingredients in a large pot over high heat.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 2-3 hours or until soup has
thickened and brownish in color. It should have the consistancy of chili. Stir
occaisonally for the first few hours but frequently in the last hour. Serve
hot.

Notes: Good! Not sure if it's quite as good as our other favorite Mulligatawny but
very good all the same. We had some trouble thickening our batch because you add so
much water to it at the beginning. You can definitely halve the water to start with
and see what develops from there. Next time I make this I'll probably only add one
quart of water before simmering.

garden. For extra flavor or heat add 2 or 3 jalapeno peppers. Recipes comes
from Betters Homes and Gardens.com

1  	cup fresh corn or frozen corn
1/2 	cup chopped onions
1/2 	cup green sweet peppers, cut in strips
1/2 	cup water
1 	cup chopped zucchini
4 	ounces shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 	cup cornmeal
2 	eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 	cup milk
1/4 	teaspoon pepper
3-5 	dashes bottled hot pepper sauce (or use jalapeno peppers)

1/2 	teaspoon salt

   to boiling; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes (If adding
   Jalapenos, add in this step).
2. Do Not drain, stir in zucchini, tomatoes, cheese and cornmeal, set aside.
3. In a small mixing bowl beat eggs; stir in milk, salt, pepper, and hot
   pepper sauce; STIR egg mixture into the vegetable mixture in saucepan.

   350 degree oven about 40 minutes or until set, Let stand for 5 minutes
   before serving.

Notes: This is quite good. It turned out a little dry for my liking; I may add
a drizzle of cooking oil to the final mixture before baking next time. The
dryness may have been due to my cooking away all the water in step 1; time
will tell. Other than that, it's a very nice colorful and flavorful dish. The
tomatoes and pepper give it a slightly south-western flavor.

A friend cans this every year and any chance I get, I beg borrow or steal
some from her! It's the best salsa I have ever had. Especially good with lime
tortilla chips or on taco salad (recipe #102234).

10 	cups roughly chopped tomatoes
5 	cups chopped and seeded bell peppers
5 	cups chopped onions
2 1/2 	cups hot peppers, chopped,seeded
1 1/4 	cups cider vinegar
3 	cloves garlic, minced
2 	tablespoons cilantro, minced
3 	teaspoons salt
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste

1. Combine all ingredients except tomato paste in large sauce pot.
2. Simmer until desired thickness.
3. Stir in tomato paste.
4. Ladle hot salsa into hot jars leaving 1/4 inch head-space.
5. Process 15 minutes in a hot water bath.
6. Note: use more hot peppers for a very hot salsa or less for mild.
7. It depends on how hot your peppers are and how hot you like your salsa.
8. I never get close to 2 1/2 cups for our mild salsa.

Notes: Pretty good - completely disregard measuring the hot peppers. It will
be way too dependent on the hotness of the peppers and your own preference.
For my first batch I could tell that the jalapenos I had grown were pretty
hot, so I only used 3. The salsa is mild, but has a pleasant tanginess to it.
For the next batch I'll probably double the number of jalapenos to 6, or may
throw in a habanero!
Also, the hotness of the salsa seems to be at its peak when fresh and before
processing. Of course, the next time I can salsa and take this into account
I'll probably make a batch of nuclear-rated salsa that hardly anybody can eat,
but that seems to be the way things go. :-)

7. enjoy!

Cucumber Salsa  #20980

This is a great thing to take to parties! Everywhere I take it, people want
the reciepe. It is also nice for people who like a salsa type dip, but do not
like the heat.

6 	cucumbers, chopped
4 	tomatoes, chopped
1 	red onion, chopped
1 	package dry ranch dressing mix
1/4 	cup vinegar
1/4 	teaspoon sugar (more or less depending on how sweet you want it)

2. In a smaller bowl, whisk the dressing and sugar with the vinegar.
3. Pour over veggies, and stir well.
4. Refrigerate overnight.

Pickled Jalapenos  #10350

A wonderful way to use those summer fresh peppers.

In each jar:
1 	teaspoon olive oil
1 	teaspoon oregano leaves
2 	cloves garlic
	sliced carrots (optional)
	sliced onions, separated into rings (optional)
Brine
1 1/2 	quarts water
2 	cups white vinegar
1/2 	cup pickling salt

4 pints

1. In clean sterilized jars, place the olive oil, oregano, garlic and carrots
   and onions (optional).
2. Mix the brine ingredients and bring to a boil.
3. Pack your peppers (and other vegetables) in jars to 3/4 full (peppers will
   expand).
4. Pour boiling brine over the peppers within 1/2" from the top.
5. Seal by hot water bath for 20 minutes.
6. Let jars sit for 3 weeks for the best flavor.

Note: You may be able to get away with processing the peppers for less time;
10 mins may be enough. I don't really think anything is going to be able to
attack jalapeno peppers in brine, but I guess you never know.
This is a good pickled pepper recipe. The oregano and garlic add a nice zip
to the flavor. These are way better than store-bought sliced jalapenos in
jars!


Pickled Jalapeno Peppers  #108201

These are excellent. Canned tons of them and everyone keeps grabbing jars and
running. Super hot!!!!

2 	cups white wine vinegar
2 	cups water
1/2 	teaspoon pickling salt or pickling spices
4 	cloves garlic

8. Process in boiling water bath for 10 minutes.

Notes: This brine has more vinegar in it than the other recipe. I don't know
if that is a factor or not... The other one has been rated a 5-star recipe, so
maybe that should be a factor.


Dill Pickle Relish  #124054

A nice addition to burgers or hot dogs. And very pretty for gift giving. You
could substitute green bell peppers for the red ones, but it wouldn't be as
attractive. You can also substitute zucchini for part of the cucumbers if
desired.

2 	cups red bell peppers, chopped
2 	cups onions, chopped
1 	cup celery, chopped
2/3 	cup salt

Corn Bread Loaf  #47189

I made a few minor changes to the original recipe printed in Bon Appetit
(December 1992). Original recipe was printed as a request for corn bread
served in Le Bus resturant.

1 1/2 	cups flour
1 1/4 	cups yellow cornmeal
3/4 	cup sugar
1/2 	teaspoon baking powder
1/2 	teaspoon baking soda
1/2 	teaspoon salt
2 	eggs
1/2 	cup melted margarine or corn oil
1 	cup buttermilk or sour milk
1 	cup frozen corn kernels, thawed

1. Preheat oven to 350-degrees F.
2. Spray 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and dust with corn meal.
3. Mix first six ingredients (flour- salt) in large bowl.
4. Mix eggs, melted margarine/oil, milk in small bowl.
5. Add egg mixture and corn to dry ingredients.
6. Stir until combined.
7. Pour batter into pan.
8. Bake for 1 hour.

Notes: One review indicated that cutting the sugar in half still produced a
sweet bread - try the given recipe first but keep this in mind.


Corn Macque Choux (Fried Corn)  #49125

I had no idea this dish even had a name until I grew up. We had it any time
we had fried chicken, which was often. I love this dish - to me it is comfort
food.

1 	onion, diced
1 	green bell pepper, diced
1 	red bell pepper, diced
1 	lb corn kernels (cut from the cob or frozen and thawed)
3 	tablespoons unsalted butter
	kosher salt
	fresh ground black pepper
1 	pinch cayenne

1. In the skillet, heat the butter over medium low heat until melted.
2. Add the onion and saute until wilted but not brown.
3. Add the bell peppers and the corn and stir to coat everything with butter,
   sprinkle with some salt, pepper, and cayenne, and continue cooking over
   med-low heat, stirring frequently, until all liquid (if any) completely
   evaporates, the vegetables start to take on a slight caramalization and the
   whole room smells really, really good. (This should take about 20 minutes).
4. Taste, adjust the seasonings if you need to, and serve.
5. Note: I say to use a cast iron skillet because, as with cornbread, I
   believe this dish suffers in flavor if it is not cooked in one. However,
   if you don't have one, you can use another skillet- just know that it would
   be much better cooked in a cast iron skillet.


Mexican Corn Salad  #68289

Nice addition to a Mexican meal.

3 	tablespoons butter
2 	cups corn kernels, cooked

1/2 	cup salsa
2 	tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

3. Saute until vegetables are tender, about 6 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and refrigerate vegetables until chilled.
5. Add salsa and chopped cilantro to vegetable mixture.
6. Stir and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Notes: May be able to serve this warm.


Preserved Basil  #69949

This came about when I had more fresh basil in my garden than I knew what to
do with it. I posted a question to the Cooking Q&A board and with the help of
Jenny Sanders, this recipe came about.

2 	cups fresh basil leaves, packed
1/2 	cup olive oil

1. Puree two cups of fresh packed basil leaves in the food processor.
2. Slowly add one half cup olive oil until the mixture has the consistency of
   a smooth paste.
3. Pour the puree into plastic ice cube trays.
4. It's best to have a special tray just for herbs, because the remaining
   flavor will then get into your ice cubes.
5. Cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until solid.
6. Store cubes, double-bagged, in the freezer and add to soups and sauces for
   an instant flavor boost.
7. Herbal pastes and pestos are highly concentrated, so use sparingly.

Hot Sauce

# The first step in the process is blanching the peppers. To do this, bring
one cup of white vinegar to a boil in a saucepan. Then add the peppers for two
or three minutes. A basic green sauce requires 15 serrano chiles and three
jalapeno peppers, but other peppers can be substituted to create different
tastes.

# After blanching, strain the vinegar from the peppers by pouring it into a
glass measuring cup. Be careful not to splash the vinegar as it is both
temperature-hot and spicy-hot.

# Peppers can be roasted prior to blanching for added flavor. Hold them over
an open flame or put into a nonstick frying pan. Heat until the skin is
slightly blistered, then proceed with blanching.

# Most recipes recommend using a food processor, but this is one for the
blender.

# After separating the peppers and vinegar, put 1/4 cup of the vinegar in the
blender along with the blanched peppers, a couple of cloves of minced garlic
and two tablespoons of ground cumin. These measurements can be varied
according to taste.

# The more of the seeds added, the hotter the sauce will be.

# Blend the mixture until it is liquefied, adding more vinegar if necessary.
Keep working with it until a desirable consistency is reached. Now pour the
sauce into a bottle using a funnel. Any sealing glass bottle will work, and
smaller hot sauce bottles are available at home stores. Be sure to label it.
Making the labels can be a fun and creative thing to do, and the sauces make
great gifts.

# Make buffalo-chicken-wing sauce by mixing five tablespoons of hot sauce
with four tablespoons of butter and one tablespoon of vinegar.

Carrot Pancakes (just like Potato Pancakes)  Recipe #34191

I ate these growing up. I don't know if my Mom happened to be out of potatoes
one day and just tried carrots or if she got them out of a book. She doesn't
remember, but I seem to remember her just substituting the carrots because we
were out of potatoes. They're much better when you keep the carrots and onion
almost to equal amounts

2 	large eggs
1/4 	cup flour
	salt, pepper
	garlic powder (optional)

Leftover Mashed Potato Pancakes  Recipe #9054

This recipe was recently submitted to a news group to which I belong. I think
it is very good and hope you like it, too. Preparation time in the kitchen is
just a few minutes. When the big meal is through, this is a tasty way to use
up the leftover mashed potatoes.

1-2 	egg
1/4 	cup flour
	salt
	pepper
	garlic
	onions (optional)
	chives (optional)
	cheese (optional)
	oil or Crisco

CHICKEN AND WHITE BEAN CHILI

1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/3 cups chopped onion
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
6 garlic cloves, chopped
2 1/4 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
3 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 15- to 16-ounce cans white beans, drained, juices reserved
2 15-ounce cans diced tomatoes in juice
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro


Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper,
and garlic; sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add
chicken; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until chicken is no longer pink
outside, about 5 minutes. Mix in chili powder, tomato paste, cumin, and
oregano. Add beans, 1 cup reserved bean juices, and canned tomatoes. Simmer
until chicken is cooked through and chili is thickened, about 25 minutes. If
chili is too thick, add more bean juices by tablespoonfuls to thin. Season
chili to taste with salt and pepper. Mix in cilantro and serve.

Notes: This is an excellent chili variant. It has a nice SouthWest flavor due
to the cumin and oregano, and the various ingredients (chicken, beans,
tomatoes, etc.) all balance very well together. For personalization of
individual servings, you could provide some shredded chedder, diced onion,
diced jalapeno, etc. at the table.

Notes: May want to substitute chicken broth for water, or reduce water to 1/2 cup.
It does not take 10 hours to cook chicken parts in a crock pot. The chicken and 
vegetables will also produce a good bit of juices on their own. You want to balance 
the amount of water with how much paprikash sauce you want. Thickening could also be
done with corn starch, though it needs to come back to a boil to thicken.

2/3 c. sugar
1 T. (yes, tablespoon) baking powder
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 cup raisins or currants (golden raisins are good)
2 eggs, beaten
1 c. buttermilk or sour milk

Sift dry ingred. together.  Stir in raisins or
currants.  In a large bowl, combine remaining ingred.
and then stir in the sifted dry ingred.  Mix just
until flour is moistened.  Turn batter into a greased
loaf pan (I use a 2 1/2-qt. casserole dish, and it's
just the right size).  Bake at 350 for a little over
an hour OR bake at 375 for about 50 min.  Use the
toothpick test to make sure loaf is baked thoroughly
in the middle.  Remove bread from pan immediately.

White Pizza with Tomatoes, Onions and Garlic
Provided by FoodFit

3/4 cup warm water
1 tablespoon milk
4 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon olive oil, plus extra
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup fresh diced tomatoes
4 ounces grated mozzarella cheese
1 small yellow onion, sliced thinly into rings
1 teaspoon dried oregano or chopped, fresh herbs
salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette (optional)

1. For the pizza dough:
2. Mix the water, milk and yeast together in a large bowl and stir with a
   wooden spoon.
3. Add the flour, salt and olive oil. Mix together with a wooden spoon until
   the dough is too thick and sticky to stir.
4. Spread a little flour on a work surface and place the dough on top of the
   flour. Knead the dough by pulling the dough from the sides and folding it
   in the middle. Keep kneading until the dough becomes a smooth ball. If it
   sticks to the table or to your hands, add a little more flour.
5. Rub a clean bowl with the olive oil and put the dough in it. Cover the
   bowl with a towel and put it in a warm place. Let the dough rise for about
   1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in volume.
6. Punch the raised dough down with your fist. Turn the dough over, form it
   into a ball again, cover, and let rise for another hour.
7. Heat the oven to 450Â°F. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin or use your
   hands to pat the dough into a circle about 12" to 14" across and 1/4"-thick.
   Place the dough on an oiled baking sheet.
8. For the topping:
9. Sprinkle the garlic and spread the olive oil over the rolled dough, then
   sprinkle the tomatoes. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese, leaving the edge of
   the pizza free. Place the onions on top of the cheese. If desired, drizzle
   a little Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette on top of the pizza for added flavor.
10. Bake until nicely browned and crispy, about 15 minutes. Season with salt
   and pepper. Cut the pizza into 8 slices.



Tangy BBQ sauce

1 cup ketchup
½ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup dark brown sugar
2 tbsp honey
¾ tsp garlic powder (or 1 clove garlic)
½ tsp paprika
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper

Combine all ingredients and whisk together in a medium bowl.  Layer sauce
with meat in a slow cooker, if making ribs as described above. If you are not
going to use this in a slow cooker recipe, pour it into a medium saucepan and
cook it for about 15 minutes on the stove over medium heat, until bubbling,
which will help the flavors to blend together.




40 Cloves and a Chicken
Recipe courtesy Alton Brown

1 whole chicken (broiler/fryer) cut into 8 pieces
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
10 sprigs fresh thyme
40 peeled cloves garlic
Salt and pepper

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Season chicken with salt and pepper. Toss with a 2 tablespoons olive oil and
brown on both sides in a wide fry pan or skillet over high heat. Remove from
heat, add oil, thyme, and garlic cloves. Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours.

Remove chicken from the oven, let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, carve, and serve.

Notes: It's good but you'll still want the time it takes to peel 40 cloves of garlic back...

Beef and Guiness Pie

3  	 tablespoons   tomato paste
3 1/2 	cups beef stock
4 	lbs beef chuck, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 1/2 	lbs white mushrooms
1 	large yellow onion, peeled and sliced
6 	cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
2 	tablespoons fresh thyme
2 	cups Guinness stout (or other dark stout)
1 1/2 	cups flour
	salt and pepper
1 	egg, for egg wash
1 	lb puff pastry, frozen or homemade

   1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
   2. Put tomato paste into a large bowl and whisk in stock until paste is
      dissolved.
   3. Add beef, mushrooms, onions, garlic, thyme and stout.
   4. Stir well.
   5. Sprinkle flour over beef mixture and season with salt and pepper.
   6. Stir well.
   7. Transfer to a deep 10 1/2 x 12 1/2 ovenproof baking dish and cover with
      foil.
   8. Bake stirring occasionally until meat is very tender- 3 1/2- 4 hours.
   9. Beat egg with 1 tsp water in a small bowl.
  10. Roll out puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch
      thick and 2 inches larger than the baking dish.
  11. Remove baking dish from oven, remove foil and drape pastry over dish.
  12. Brush with egg wash.
  13. Return dish to oven and bake until pastry is puffed and deep golden
      brown- about 40 minutes.

Notes: You may not need all of the beef broth when putting this together -
it's a lot of liquid (3 1/2 cups beef broth, 2 cups stout). Also, as you can
probably tell from the quantites of ingredients, this makes enough food to
feed a small army. Be prepared to freeze some of this or have a good-sized
dinner party. Goes VERY well with colcannon.
Freezes ok, but is better fresh out of the oven.



THAI-CURRIED GAME HENS

The delicious sauce has the complex, aromatic flavors of a Thai curry, but is
very easy to prepare, thanks to purchased curry paste (now sold in many
supermarkets). Look for fresh or frozen kaffir lime leaves  whose beautiful
fragrance is the signature of many Thai dishes  at Asian markets. If
unavailable, don't use dried ones; substitute grated lime peel instead. Goes
great with: Long-grain rice cooked with a few cardamom pods and grated lemon
peel and sautéed spinach. What to drink: Spätlese Riesling or Oregon Pinot
Noir.

3 tablespoons grapeseed oil or olive oil, divided
2 teaspoons (about) Thai red curry paste*
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk*
1 cup low-salt chicken broth
2 5.95-ounce cans straw mushrooms, drained
3 kaffir lime leaves or 2 teaspoons grated lime peel
2 tablespoons fish sauce (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)*
1 tablespoon (packed) golden brown sugar
6 cherry tomatoes, quartered
2 1 1/4-pound Cornish game hens, thawed if frozen, halved lengthwise,
  backbones removed
Fresh basil leaves
Small fresh or dried red chiles** (optional garnish)

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add curry
paste and tomato paste and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add coconut
milk, broth, mushrooms, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and brown sugar; bring
to simmer. Remove from heat. Add cherry tomatoes. Season sauce to taste with
salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over
high heat. Sprinkle hens with salt and pepper. Add hens to skillet and cook
until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer hens to 13x9x2-inch glass or
ceramic baking dish. Pour sauce over. Bake uncovered until hens are cooked
through, about 35 minutes. Transfer hens to shallow serving bowl; tent with
foil. Skim fat from sauce. Pour sauce into large skillet; boil 5 minutes. Pour
sauce over hens. Garnish with basil and chiles, if desired.

*  Sold in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.

** Use any type of small fresh or dried chiles you find in the produce section
   or spice section of the supermarket.

Test-kitchen tip: Curry pastes vary in strength and spiciness from brand to
brand, so start by using one teaspoon if you prefer a milder sauce.



BAKED POTATO SOUP

This is the best potato soup ever.  The recipe is from
an ad for Carnation Evaporated Milk, changed slightly
by Faye.

1/4 c. (½ stick) butter
1/4 c. chopped onion
1/4 c. flour
1 can (14.5 oz.) chicken broth
1 5-oz. can evaporated milk
1 c. regular milk
2 large or 3 medium baking potatoes, microwaved till
done
1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper
Toppings: cooked crumbled bacon or bacon bits from a
jar, shredded cheddar cheese, sliced green onions

Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat.  Add
onion; cook, stirring occasionally, for 1-2 min. or
until tender.  Stir in flour.  Gradually stir in broth
and the two milks.  Scoop potato pulp from potato,
reserving the skin; mash.  Add pulp to broth mixture.
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until
mixture comes just to a boil.  Dice remaining potato
skin and potato(es); add to soup.  Heat through.
Spoon into bowls.  Sprinkle each with the toppings
that
appeal to you.  Makes about 4 servings.



CRANBERRY BARLEY PILAF

This recipe, from Crystal McKnew of Arnold, MD,
appeared in a local newspaper.  Crystal calls for ½
cup of toasted pecans to be added at the end, but we
have found that they do not stand up to the flavors of
the broth and cranberries and are not worth using.
Also, the original recipe uses chopped fresh
cranberries,
but dried cranberries are much easier, and just as
tasty.

1/4 c. (½ stick) butter or margarine
1 c. chopped onion
2 stalks celery, sliced quite thinly
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 c. barley
3 c. canned chicken broth
½ -3/4 c. craisins
1 T. honey

Heat butter or marg. in a saucepan [I, Mom, use a
frying pan] over medium heat until melted.  Add onion,
celery, garlic, and barley.  Cook until onion is
tender and the barley turns golden, stirring
constantly.  Add broth; bring to a boil.  Lower heat,
cover, and simmer for about 35 min.  Stir in the
craisins and honey; continue simmering, covered, about
10 more minutes.  Remove from heat.  Let stand,
covered, 5 min.  Makes about 8 servings.



HAM AND PINEAPPLE CASSEROLE

This recipe won third prize in some sort of a contest.
It was contributed by Marilou Robinson of Portland,
Oregon.  The casserole could easily be assembled ahead
of time and baked later.  It would be good served as a
brunch or light supper and would even be an easy but
delicious dish to take to a potluck.

½ c. (½ stick) margarine, softened
½ c. granulated sugar
5 large eggs
1 ½ c. cubed cooked ham
1 20-oz. can pineapple tidbits, drained
2 T. lemon juice
8-10 slices slightly stale white bread, cut into cubes

Coat a 13x9-inch casserole dish with nonstick spray.
Preheat oven to 325.  In a large bowl, cream together
marg. and sugar.  Beat in eggs, one at a time, until
well mixed.  Stir in ham, pineapple, and lemon juice.
Fold in bread cubes.  Pour mixture into casserole
dish, smoothing the top.  Bake, uncovered, for 30-35
min., or until custard is set and top is golden.
Serves 6 to 8.  Note: I've used whole wheat bread for
half the slices with good results.


BBQ Beans and Sausage Crock Pot Recipe #199155

A great meal! Quick and Simple! Crock pot!
by nannymelissa

2 (15 	ounce) cans great northern beans, rinsed and drained
2 (15 	ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 	cup onions, chopped
1 	cup barbecue sauce
1/4 	cup packed brown sugar
1 	tablespoon ground mustard
1 	tablespoon worcestershire sauce
2 	teaspoons chili powder
1-1 1/4 	lb fully cooked smoked sausage

   1. Spray slow cooker with cooking spray.
   2. Mix all ingredients except sausage in crock pot.

Roasted Cauliflower with indian barbecue sauce
Makes 6 side-dish servings

1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 2-pound head of cauliflower, cut into 1-inch florets (about 8 cups)
4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger
1 garlic clove, pressed
1 1/4 cups ketchup
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons sugar

Preheat oven to 400°F. Toast cumin in small skillet over medium heat until
darker in color and beginning to smoke, about 1 1/2 minutes. Set aside.

Toss cauliflower and 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl. Transfer to medium
rimmed baking sheet. Roast until very tender, stirring occasionally, about 45
minutes.

Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over medium-low
heat. Add ginger and garlic; sauté until very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add
ketchup, soy sauce, sugar, and toasted cumin. Bring to boil, whisking to
blend. Reduce heat to very low; simmer barbecue sauce 1 minute to blend
flavors, whisking constantly.

Remove cauliflower from oven; transfer to large bowl. Toss with enough
barbecue sauce to coat; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Notes: Very good! The sauce would be excellent on a number of items including
egg rolls, pita, corn chips, etc. You make about 4 times more sauce than
you'll use on the cauliflower, and I didn't bother tossing it in the sauce -
everybody was content to dip.

Spicy Thai Noodles with Vegetables 
Recipe #64290

This makes an excellent side dish to go with main-dish stir fries or satays.
Add meat to make a main dish. You can locate lemongrass and fish sauce in most
Oriental markets.

4 servings
time to make 30 min 20 min prep
16 	ounces rice noodles or rice vermicelli
2 	cups mung bean sprouts
1 	cup slivered carrots
8 	scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 	yellow bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 	red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 	stalk lemongrass, white part only,sliced thin
10 	Thai chiles, stemmed and split (optional)
	cooking oil
1/4 	cup chopped peanuts
2 	tablespoons chopped cilantro (coriander)
For the Sauce
2/3 	cup creamy peanut butter
4 	tablespoons brown sugar
6 	tablespoons soy sauce
4 	tablespoons fish sauce
1/4 	teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 	teaspoon grated fresh ginger
2 	limes, juice of

 1. Cook noodles in boiling water until tender; drain.
 2. Mix ingredients for sauce in a bowl with a whisk until smooth; set aside.
 3. Heat 2 tablespoons cooking oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat
    (add more oil as necessary during cooking).
 4. Add lemongrass and Thai chiles and cook until fragrant.
 5. Add carrot, scallions, and bell peppers and cook until carrot starts to
    become crisp-tender.
 6. Add bean sprouts and cook 1-2 minutes more.
 7. Add drained noodles to the pan and pour sauce over noodles.
 8. Using two utensils, lift vegetables from bottom to integrate throughout
    noodles and mix well.
 9. Garnish with chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts and serve with hot
    chili sauce (sriracha), if desired.
10. Cooking tip: you may cut noodles into smaller pieces after cooking with
    kitchen shears to make them easier to work with.

NOTES: This is very good. I'd like to tweak the sauce a little bit, as we found
the peanut butter masked the flavor of most of the other ingredients. The next
time I make this I will reduce peanut butter to 1/2 cup, reduce brown sugar to
2 tablespoons, increase soy sauce to 7 tablespoons, increase fish sauce to 5
tablespoons, increase fresh grated ginger to 1 tablespoon (and may add some
diced ginger as well), drop the cayenne pepper in favor of 1/2 teaspoon asian
chili paste. I'm not sure how that's going to go together, but we found the
sauce on the sweet side. The stir fry itself is very good, though you do not
need an entire pound of rice noodles. You could also add  some other nice stir
fry ingredients like broccoli florets, mushrooms, snow peas, and especially
some tofu at the end.

soup among bowls. Scatter red onion, green onions, cilantro, and chiles over
soup. Garnish with lime wedges and serve.


POTATOES SAVOYARDE

Savoy is a region in France, and this recipe comes from the book "French Cooking for Americans" written
by French chef Louis Diat, published in 1946.  I have changed the directions slightly.

4-5 large potatoes
1 med. onion, sliced
5-6 thin slices Swiss cheese
2 T. butter
1/4 tsp. salt
chicken or vegetable stock or water

Peel and cut potatoes in very thin slices.
Cook onion in butter until soft but not brown; stir in salt.
In a casserole dish, place a layer of potato slices, then some onion, and
  some cheese.  Repeat layers until the ingredients are used up.
Pour in some stock [I use chicken broth], but do NOT fill to the top with
  broth.
Bake at 400 for about 45 min. or until potatoes are done and top is brown.
Makes 3 or 4 servings.

Notes: A stylish potatoes au gratin.

Spicy Baked Macaroni

Recipe courtesy Giada De Laurentiis   Show: Everyday Italian

Salt
1 pound elbow macaroni pasta
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 pound assorted mushrooms, quartered
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed and drained of excess liquid
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cups bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/3 cup
1/4 cup Romano, plus 1/3 cup
2 tablespoons butter, softened, plus 2 tablespoons
12 ounces mozzarella cubed (about 2 cups)
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and
cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8
to 10 minutes. Drain pasta.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms,
onion, and garlic. Cook until the mushrooms are tender and the onion is
golden, about 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, spinach, and red pepper flakes.
Stir to combine and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.

In a small bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, 1/4 cup Parmesan, and 1/4 cup
Romano. Spread the softened butter in a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish and
sprinkle half of the bread crumb mixture inside the dish to coat.

In a large bowl combine the vegetable mixture with the cooked macaroni, cubed
mozzarella, the remaining Parmesan and Romano cheeses, and the nutmeg. Spoon
into the prepared baking dish, top with the remaining bread crumb mixture, and
dot the top with the remaining butter. Bake until the top is golden brown,
about 30 to 40 minutes.

Notes: This takes a bit of work but is a very good dish. The mushrooms and
spinach and tomatoes add a nice heartiness to the dish beyond the pasta and
cheese.

Mexican Rice Recipe #117892

Are you craving that great rice from your favorite taco stand? Here it is. This is just like a good Mexican restaurant rice. Many recipes taste good... but the texture just isn't right. You know how it is... you have prepared scores of Mexican rice recipes but always have been disappointed. It may be delicious but kinda "gloopy and wet." Try this. Everything is pureed and cooked in. There are no chunks of anything... just dry fluffy rice with all the seasonings and just the tiniest hint of a tomato flavor. I will throw away all of my Mexican rice recipes- this is the one I have been looking for for years!

by Pot Scrubber

55 min | 20 min prep | SERVES 6 -8

12 	ounces tomatoes, very ripe and cored
1 	medium white onion
3 	medium jalapenos
2 	cups long grain white rice
1/3 	cup canola oil
4 	minced garlic cloves
2 	cups chicken broth
1 	tablespoon tomato paste
1 1/2 	teaspoons salt
1/2 	cup fresh cilantro, minced
1 	lime

   1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350.
   2. Process tomato and onion in processor or blender until pureed and thoroughly smooth. Transfer mixture to measuring cup and reserve exactly 2 cups. Discard excess.
   3. Remove ribs and seeds from 2 jalapenos and discard. Mince flesh and set aside. Mince remaining jalapeno. Set aside.
   4. Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear- about 1 1/2 minutes.Shake rice vigorously to remove excess water.This step removes the starch from the rice so it will not stick. IF YOU OMIT THIS STEP YOUR RICE WILL NOT BE DRY AND FLUFFY.
   5. Heat oil in heavy bottomed ovensafe 12 inch straight sided sautee pan or Dutch oven with tight fitting lid over medium high heat about 2 minutes. (The recipe is very specific about this but I used a 10 inch dutch oven and it worked out fine.) Drop a few rice grains in and if they sizzle then it is ready. Add rice and fry stirring until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.
   6. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and 2 minced jalapenos and cook , stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes.
   7. Stir in broth, pureed mixture,tomato paste, and salt. Increase heat to medium high, and bring to a boil.
   8. Cover pan and transfer pan to oven to bake until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 30-35 minutes.Stir well after 15 minutes.
   9. Stir in cilantro, minced jalapeno to taste, and pass lime wedges separately.
  10. Edited to add 6-15-05: If you can't get good fresh tomatoes you are better off using canned tomatoes. Don't use those awful hard and underipe tomatoes that are at most supermarket chains. Just be sure that the processed tomatoes and the one onion equals 2 cups. One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference.
  11. Edited 8-21-06: Do not skip any of the steps. It may seem stupid- but rinsing the rice to remove the starch is very important if you want fluffy rice. It will only take two minutes of your time but it makes the difference.
  12. You're gonna like it.

      Using a spoon, rub the mixture on the bird, spreading it evenly; continue roasting.

Senegalese Chicken and Peanut Soup Recipe #109454

This is an award winning soup recipe. The soup should be silky and smooth but
not thick; it should be spicy, but not too hot; it should have a sharpness of
tomato and lemon, but not be sour; it should taste of peanuts, but not of
peanut butter. It freezes beautifully. Note - I just adopted this one -- it
was originally posted by my friend Mean Chef -- the intro is perfect and is
exactly what you should be tasting in the final product! :-)

Eggplant (Aubergine) -Spinach Curry

Ingredients

 1 large eggplant, cut into 1 1/2 centimeter cubes, with skin
 2 teaspoons kosher salt
 2 tablespoons brown mustard seeds
 2 tablespoons canola oil
 1 large onion, diced
 6 garlic cloves, minced
 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced
 1 teaspoon cumin, ground
 1/2 teaspoon coriander, freshly ground
 1/2 teaspoon cardamom, freshly ground

 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
 1 (796 ml) can diced tomatoes
 2 (300 g) packages frozen spinach, thawed and drained
 3/4 cup plain yogurt
 3/4 cup cilantro, chopped

Directions

Put eggplant cubes in colander over large bowl, sprinkle with kosher salt,
and let stand for 30 minutes to sweat. Pat dry and remove excess salt with
paper towels or clean dishcloth. (Careful, this juice stains!).

Toast mustard seeds in a small dry non-stick pan over medium-low heat until
they turn grey and begin to pop. Remove from heat and reserve in a small bowl.

Place eggplant in a mid-sized steamer and cook for about 10 minutes, until
eggplant is soft and tender but not mushy. Remove from heat and reserve.

Heat canola oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until
golden. Stir in garlic, ginger, and all other spices, being careful to avoid
scorching.

After 1 minute, add spinach and tomatoes. Raise heat to high and boil for 2
minutes, stirring often. Turn heat down to low and simmer with lid on for 20
minutes to allow flavours to blend.

Stir in reserved mustard seeds and eggplant. Once eggplant is hot, stir in
yogurt and chopped cilantro. Remove from heat.

Serve alone on a bed of rice, or with a beef curry and naan bread.

Okonomiyaki Sauce
Ingredients:
1/4 cup ketchup
1 1/2 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp. dijon mustard
2 Tbsp. rice wine
1 tsp. soy sauce
Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan and heat until bubbly. Simmer about 30 seconds more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.

What's this for? Look below...


Okonomiyaki
Base:
1 cup flour
3/4 cup dashi (or water, see below)*
1 egg
1/8-1/4 of a cabbage

Toppings - any of the below:
Chicken
Roast pork or beef
Squid, Octopus, other seafood
Corn
Mushrooms
Onion

Sauces:
Okonomiyaki sauce (or tonkatsu sauce)
Mayonnaise

* Dashi is japanese stock, used in heaps of different recipes. When made 
up it smells like smoked fish and seaweed. You can buy it from oriental 
grocers in sachets that come in boxes like the one to the right of the 
beer in the picture above. Just mix up a bit with some hot water. If you 
can't find it, it's okay - just use water. 

Step 1:
So firstly grab that cabbage and chop it up finely. Better to have too 
much than too little because it shrinks a little as it cooks, and it's 
mega cheap anyway. Get out as much of the white stem parts as you can. 

Step 2: 
Now break an egg into a large bowl and pour in the dashi/water, and the 
flour. 

Step 3: 
Then beat with a whisk until smooth. 

Step 4: 
Now add some of the finely chopped cabbage and mix as best you can.  

Step 5: 
Heat up your skillet, electric frypan, grill, whatever you're going to 
use to cook this baby. Preferably use something that's got teflon on it 
:-) 

Step 6: 
Now prepare your toppings. I'm using Chinese BBQ pork slices, a little 
bell pepper, some onion, mushrooms, parsely and spring onion. Just chop 
it all up good. 

Step 7: 
Throw it all in the frypan with some oil (sesame is good) to keep it all 
well-lubed. Cook until either heated through or in the case of raw meat 
or veges, for a few minutes until it's getting close to being cooked. 
NOTE: If there are no raw ingredients in your toppings you can throw 
everything in with the batter from the start.

Step 8: 
Arrange the nearly cooked toppings in a round... 

Step 9: 
Then throw the cabbage/dough mixture on top, also in a round! 

Step 10: 
Turn up the heat a little to medium and let that bad boy cook through 
for 5 minutes or so. Then flip it. In the picture below, I had to cut 
the round in half to flip it, which doesn't matter because we'll be 
cutting it into pieces later anyway. You could always make two 
okonomiyaki instead! 

Let it cook for another 5-10 minutes. You can break away a bit of the 
dough bit when it doesn't look raw any more and see if the cabbage and 
dough is cooked through. 

Step 11: 
Flip it out onto a plate and cover liberally with Okonomiyaki sauce and 
mayonnaise! OH GOD MY TASTEBUDS! 

Step 12: 
Cut, serve and savour! Bon apetit. 

 

 
Goi Cuon (Vietnamese Cold Spring Rolls) Recipe #20445

30 min | 30 min prep

24 rolls, aprox

    * 1 package clear edible rice paper sheet
    * 1/2 lb cooked chicken
    * 1/2 lb cooked small shrimp (, peeled, deveined, halved)
    * 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves
    * 1 bunch fresh mint leaves
    * 1 head leafy lettuce, washed and separated into leaves
    * 1 cucumber, peeled and cut into very,very thin strips
    * 1 cup fresh bean sprout, optional
    * 1 package vermicelli rice noodles, prepared according to package directions
    * hoisin sauce, to taste
    * chopped peanuts
    * nuoc nam, vietnamese spicy fish sauce

   1. Have all meats precooked and cold and the rice noodles prepared already (the noodles should be white, long and at room temp).
   2. Make sure all veggies and herbs are cleaned, dried, and set out before you start.
   3. Dip a sheet of rice paper wrapper into water very quickly, no longer than a second or two (or they will get too soggy) and lay flat on a work surface.
   4. On one edge, lay a small handful of noodles, a few strips of meat, some shrimp, some cilantro and mint leaves, a lettuce leaf, some cucumber strips and bean sprouts, all to taste but don't overstuff.
   5. Carefully start to roll up eggroll style, tucking in the sides, then continue to roll up-but not too tightly or the spring roll will split.
   6. These rolls will be thicker than the typical Chinese-style fried eggrolls.
   7. Combine a few spoonfulls of hoisin sauce with some chopped peanuts to use as a dipping sauce (or serve with prepared spicy fish sauce dip called Nuoc Mam, available at Asian markets).
   8. Serve immediately- these do not keep and will harden up in the fridge, so it is best to make just as many as you plan to serve (store any extra unassembled fillings in fridge and roll later).
   9. Note: Please be sure to get the correct spring roll rice papers- these are not the same as wonton/eggroll wrappers, which must be cooked.
  10. Look for edible rice paper wrappers, rice noodle vermicelli, and hoisin sauce in Asian markets.

Three Sisters Soup
http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/three-sisters-soup-410371

Ingredients

    * 1 cup dried pinto bean, soaked overnight in 4 cups water
    * 1 acorn squash
    * 1-2 tablespoon olive oil
    * 1 onion, diced
    * 1 carrot, sliced
    * 4 garlic cloves, minced
    * 1 celery rib, sliced
    * 4 cups vegetable stock
    * 1 cup corn
    * 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 2T fresh)
    * salt and pepper

1. Drain and rinse soaked beans. Put them in a pot and cover with water by an inch. Bring to a boil 
   and simmer for about 45 minutes or until tender but not mushy. Add more water if necessary.
2. While beans are cooking, cut squash in half and scoop out seeds. Bake squash halves, cut side up, 
   in a 375-degree oven for about 45 minutes or until tender.
3. Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onions and a pinch of salt and saute over medium heat, stirring 
   often until golden, about 10 minutes.
4. Add carrot, garlic and celery and saute for 5-10 minutes.
5. Scoop cooked squash out of shell. Add to onion mixture and mix well, smoothing out any large lumps.
6. Add stock and bring to a boil.
7. Turn down heat and add beans, corn and thyme. Simmer, covered, for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
8. Salt and pepper to taste.
9. Serve hot with crusty bread.

Notes: I sliced the acorn squash into wedges, sprinkled with s&p and drizzled olive oil over it before baking.
  When that was done it looked so nice I didn't want to mash it up so I cut it into chunks. As a result the soup
  is probably more brothy. It is still very good! I also forgot to add the corn but did not miss it. Definitely
  should make this soup again.

1/2 cup white wine (I like Bella Sera Pino Grigio)
salt
pepper
2 cups sliced mushrooms
4 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup roma tomatoes

1 (8 ounce) unsalted butter, softened
1 (16 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon marjoram, fresh or dried
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives
1/4 teaspoon thyme, fresh or dried

Harry & Davids Sweet and Hot Pepper and Onion Relish Clone

6 cups tomatoes, skinned, diced and drained
6 large red peppers, diced (I used multiple colors from garden)
8 cups sugar
2 tablespoons salt
1 (4 ounce) pectin
3 cups white vinegar
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
3 large onions, diced 

1. Recipe called for two small boxes of pectin - I have no idea if a small box is 1 or 2 ounces so I guess at 2 ounces -- so be careful!
2. Mix all ingredients together, except pectin and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down and simmer for 2 - 2 1/2 hours until thickened.
4. Whisk in the 2 boxes of pectin and boil for 1 minute.
5. Pour into sterile jars.
6. Process in pressure canner at #11 for 15 minutes.
7. Notes: I increased the peppers and the ground red. I actually used scotch hots and it still lost some of the heat in the canning process. 
   This always happens to me! Go ahead and be a little generous on the heat because it seems to leave the product after canning. 
   Also, in using the 8 cups of sugar, you need the hot pepper to balance out the sweet.
8. It seems like a long time to cook but it makes a beautiful transformation from orange/red to a deep jewel ruby red. 
   It is necessary to cook it the 2 hours because it becomes thick (unlike fresh salsa that stays thin).
9. Recipe reads that it makes about 7 pints. Not sure about that since I increased the vegetables. 
   I would can in jelly jars because one mixed with 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese was plenty of dip.
10. I did not pressure can. I water-boiled for 10 minutes. They all set up perfectly.
11. It was a success. Tasted great, just wish it was a little spicier. I added cayenne to my cream cheese mixture.

Standard Limoncello Recipe

There are many limoncello recipes available on the internet but since Im engaged in a 
pseudo-scientific endeavor here, it makes sense to publish my basic recipe. Wanna hear it? Here it go:

Ingredients:

2 750ml bottles of pure grain alcohol
The zest of 17 lemons
3.5 cups of white sugar
5 cups of water

Instructions:

Zest the lemons, put them in a glass one-gallon jar with the alcohol and let it sit for 45 days. 
Then mix the sugar and water in a pot and bring to a boil for 5 minutes. 
Let the mixture sit until completely cool and then mix with the alcohol and lemon infusion. 
Let that mixture sit for 45 days. 
Filter the mixture 4 times using #4 coffee filters. Bottle the liquid and put it in the freezer.

Thats the short, basic version. Theres a lot more to it though and it would be wise of you to check the 
Limoncello Tips page for all the gory details.
   
   
   
Waffle House Waffles
   
50 year old top secret recipe for Waffle House waffles. Waffles are made this way in all 1479 chain stores.
Ingredients:

    * 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    * 1 tsp. salt
    * 1/2 tsp. baking soda
    * 1 egg
    * 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar
    * 2 Tbsp. butter, softened
    * 2 Tbsp. vegetable shortening
    * 1/2 cup half and half
    * 1/2 cup milk
    * 1/4 cup buttermilk
    * 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:

Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Stir to combine.

Lightly beat the egg in another medium bowl. Add the sugar, butter, and shortening. Mix well with an electric mixer 
until smooth. Add the half and half, milk, buttermilk, and vanilla. Mix well

Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. Mix only briefly. It's okay if there are small lumps in the batter, 
since over beating could produce waffles that are too tough.

Cover and chill over night. (You can use the batter right away if you like, but a good 12 hour chill, makes a 
better batter.)

Rub a light coating of vegetable oil on your waffle iron or use a non-stick spray. Preheat the waffle iron. 
Leave the batter out of the refrigerator to warm up a bit as you waffle iron is preheating.

Spoon 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter into the waffle iron and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the waffles are brown.

Notes: Tasty! Very close to the restaurant recipe.



The Original Applebee's Bourbon Street Steak Marinade

4 tablespoons   Worcestershire sauce
4 tablespoons soy sauce
8 teaspoons chili powder
8 teaspoons minced garlic
3 teaspoons meat tenderizer
4 teaspoons paprika
4 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon ground oregano
4 cups water 

Mix and marinate.
Notes: It's a decent marinade. When I made it I didn't have onion powder or meat tenderizer, and
I skipped the red pepper to make it more friendly for kids. It wasn't really recognizable as the
Applebee's Bourbon St. steak but it was tasty nonetheless.


Cracker Barrels White Gravy

# 3/4 teaspoon black pepper
# 1/2 teaspoon salt 

1. Brown the bacon in a large skillet, over medium-high heat, and then remove and crumble.
2. Add the butter and onions to the pan, and cook until onions are just browning.
3. Turn the heat to low and add the flour. Cook for about 3 minutes or until the roux smells nutty.
4. Whisk in the milk, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil over low heat, stirring often.
5. Add the crumbled bacon.


Shrimp Creole

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups chopped onions
1 cup finely chopped celery
2 medium green peppers, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup butter
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 cup water
2 tablespoons fresh snipped parsley ( or 2 tsp dried)
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon red cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon thyme
2 whole bay leaves, crushed in hand to release flavor
1 lb shrimp, peeled,deveined and raw
3 cups hot cooked long-grain rice
1/4 cup chopped green onions
Tabasco sauce

Directions

   1. In a Dutch oven, cook and stir onion, celery, green pepper and garlic in butter until onion is tender.
   2. Remove from heat; stir in tomato sauce, water and seasonings.
   3. Simmer uncovered 10 minutes.
   4. Place shrimp on top of liquid in pot.
   5. Heat to boiling, cover and cook about 10 minutes until shrimp are opaque and tender.
   6. Stir all.
   7. Serve over hot rice, top with green onions and pass the Tobasco!

Notes: This is very good! It goes together quite simply and doesn't take very long to make. I did not 
  need nearly as much butter as was called for - you only need enough to saute your veggies.
   
   
   
Smoky Shrimp, Hominy and Tortilla Soup
   
    * 4 5-inch-diameter corn tortillas, halved, cut into thin strips

    * 2 tablespoons olive oil
    * 1 cup finely chopped onion
    * 1 cup finely chopped carrot
    * 1/2 cup finely chopped celery
    * 6 garlic cloves, minced
    * 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
    * 7 cups canned low-salt chicken broth
    * 2 15-ounce cans golden hominy, drained
    * 1/3 cup canned crushed tomatoes with added purée
    * 2 teaspoons chopped canned chipotle chilies*

    * 1 pound uncooked small shrimp, peeled, deveined
    * 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
    * Lime wedges

Spread corn tortilla strips in single layer on paper towel. Let tortilla strips stand at room temperature overnight to dry.

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. 
Add chopped onion, chopped carrot, chopped celery, minced garlic and dried oregano. 
Sauté until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. 
Add chicken broth, golden hominy, crushed tomatoes and chipotle chilies; bring to simmer. 
Reduce heat, cover and simmer 30 minutes. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
(Soup can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate soup uncovered until cold, then cover soup and refrigerate.)

Bring soup to simmer over medium heat. 
Add shrimp and cook until opaque in center, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. 
Stir in chopped fresh cilantro. 

Top servings with dried tortilla strips. 
Pass lime wedges separately.

Notes: This is good! Very different from what we normally have. The hominy is like
small corn dumplings. The shrimp as the meat in the soup is a nice change of pace as well.
Doesn't do so great in the freezer unless you eat it quickly, though.



Refried Beans Without the Refry 

Ingredients

    * 1 onion, peeled and halved
    * 3 cups dry pinto beans, rinsed
    * 1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
    * 2 tablespoons minced garlic
    * 5 teaspoons salt
    * 1 3/4 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper
    * 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin, optional
    * 9 cups water

1. Place the onion, rinsed beans, jalapeno, garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin into a slow cooker. 
   Pour in the water and stir to combine. Cook on High for 8 hours, adding more water as needed. 
   Note: if more than 1 cup of water has evaporated during cooking, then the temperature is too high.
2. Once the beans have cooked, strain them, and reserve the liquid. 
   Mash the beans with a potato masher, adding the reserved water as needed to attain desired consistency.

Notes: Good and nobody missed the refrying step.   


Chipotle Salsa

1 14.5 oz can of peeled whole tomatoes
2 peppers from a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce 
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2-3 cloves of garlic
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup cilantro

Blend!

Notes: Original recipe called for 1 chipotle but 2 seemed much better. I also bumped up the garlic
by a couple of cloves. I might try fire roasted tomatoes next time. Overall a very good and simple
salsa. I think you could easily substitute fresh chili peppers of any variety if you'd prefer something
other than the smokey chipotle flavor.



Salsa Verde

tomatillos (about 12)
2 jalapenos for every 3 tomatillos
4-6 cloves garlic, peeled
half a bunch cilantro, rinsed and ready for use
2 limes
salt

1. Husk tomatillos, rinse. Put in pot.
2. Remove stems and membrane from jalapenos. Put in pot.
3. Cover tomatillos and jalapenos with water, boil for about 10 minutes.
4. Use spoon to remove tomatillos and jalapenos from water. Save cooking water.
5. Put tomatillos, jalapenos, cilantro and garlic into blender. (may need multiple batches - divide ingredients equally)
6. Add lime and salt to taste. If salsa is too thick add some cooking water to right consistency.

Notes: Good and really couldn't be much easier. I was concerned about the amount of jalapenos involved and didn't want
       to flame anybody out. However, they really lose potency during the cooking process so use the recommended
	   amount without fear.



Brazilian Feijoada

Ingredients
    * 2  cups  dried black beans
    * 4  slices applewood-smoked bacon
    * 1  pound  boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
    * 3/4  teaspoon  salt, divided
    * 1/2  teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper, divided
    * 3  bone-in beef short ribs, trimmed (about 2 pounds)
    * 3  cups  finely chopped onion (about 2 medium)
    * 1 1/4  cups  fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
    * 4  garlic cloves, minced
    * 1  (9-ounce) smoked ham hock
    * 1  tablespoon  white vinegar
    * 8  orange wedges
	
1. Place beans in a small saucepan; cover with cold water. Bring to a boil; cook for 2 minutes. 
   Remove from heat; cover and let stand 1 hour. Drain.

2. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan; crumble. 
   Sprinkle pork evenly with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Increase heat to medium-high. 
   Add pork to drippings in skillet; sauté 8 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. 
   Transfer pork to a 6-quart electric slow cooker. Sprinkle ribs evenly with 1/8 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. 
   Add ribs to skillet; cook 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Place ribs in slow cooker. 
   Add drained beans, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, onion, and next 3 ingredients (through ham hock) to slow cooker, stirring to combine. 
   Cover and cook on LOW 8 hours or until beans and meat are tender.

3. Remove ribs from slow cooker; let stand 15 minutes. Remove meat from bones; shred meat with 2 forks. Discard bones. 
   Discard ham hock. Return beef to slow cooker. Stir in vinegar and crumbled bacon. Serve with orange wedges.

Notes: Really good! We had a pork shoulder that was larger than 1 pound so we skipped the ham hock.
       It's good enough to feed to company.

	   
	   
Roasted salmon with marinated fennel and thyme

  Marinated fennel:

  3 pounds fennel (3 bulbs)
  2 onions, sliced
  4 garlic cloves, sliced
  2 lemons, sliced lengthwise into thin strips and seeds removed
  4 sprigs fresh thyme
  2/3 cup Passover white wine vinegar (optional)
  Pinch of sugar dissolved in 1 teaspoon water
  Coarse sea salt or kosher salt
  Coarsely ground black pepper
  Extra-virgin olive oil to cover

  1. Wash, dry and trim the fennel stalks till they meet the top and sides of the bulb. 
     Remove dry or pulpy outer leaves, stalks and edible leaves. 
     Discard or save the outer leaves and stalks for soup and the leaves for garnish.

  2. Slice the bulbs thinly crosswise. Place the slices in a large glass or non-reactive 
     bowl with the onion, garlic, lemon and thyme. Mix in vinegar and sugar water. 
     Season with 11/2 teaspoons salt and several grinds of pepper and cover with extra-virgin 
     olive oil (or half olive oil, half vegetable oil), making sure that the olive oil covers the fennel.

  3. Submerge the vegetables using a dish smaller than the circumference of the bowl, weighted 
     with a kettle half-filled with water. Set aside for several hours at room temperature or, 
     if making the day before, place in a tightly closed jar and refrigerate. This makes about 3 
     quarts marinated fennel, more than is needed for the remainder of the recipe. The salad 
     will keep, covered and refrigerated, for 3 to 5 days; drain the salad before serving.

  Salmon and assembly:

  Several bunches of fresh thyme
  1 (2-pound) center-cut, skin-on salmon fillet
  Coarse salt to taste
  4 cups drained marinated fennel, divided
  1/3 cup oil from marinated fennel

  1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Arrange the thyme sprigs in single layer in center of a 
     heavy baking sheet. Place the salmon, skin side down, atop the thyme. Season the salmon 
	 with half teaspoon salt, or to taste. Spread 2 cups drained marinated fennel (including 
	 lemon slices and thyme sprigs) over the fish. Drizzle the oil over the fish. The fish 
	 can be prepared up to 8 hours in advance, covered and refrigerated.

  2. Roast the salmon until the outside of the fish is opaque and the fennel salad is just 
     beginning to caramelize, about 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees 
	 and continue to cook until the salmon has reached desired doneness, 5 to 10 minutes. 
	 Remove from heat and serve with the remaining marinated fennel.

Seven-chile chili

Ingredients:
6 anchos
2 pasilla
2 costeñas
2 guajillos
4 chiles de arbol
4 pieces of bacon
4 pounds of chuck roast, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
1 large onion diced
6 cloves of garlic, crushed
1 cup of brewed coffee
1 bottle of beer
2 cups of water
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp clove
1/2 tsp allspice
1 tsp coriander
1/2 tsp cayenne
1 tablespoon cumin
(For all spices, please feel free to add more to taste throughout cooking if you like.)
2 chipotles in adobo
Salt to taste
1/4 cup masa harina
1/3 Mexican hot chocolate tablet, grated

Method:
Heat the dried chiles (anchos, pasillas, costenos, guajillos and chiles de arbol) in a dry, 
cast-iron skillet on medium for a couple of minutes on each side. Turn off the heat and then 
add enough water to the skillet to cover the chiles, and let them soak for half an hour.

Meanwhile, in a large heavy pot, such as a Dutch oven, fry up your bacon. When done, remove 
from pan and crumble (Dont worry if you opt to eat a sliceyou deserve it!) and leave the 
bacon grease in the pot (it should be about 3) tablespoons. In the pot, cook your beef in 
the bacon grease on medium heat, a few minutes on each side until lightly browned. You will 
probably have to cook these in two batches.

Remove the browned beef from the pot, and add your onions. Cook on medium until clear. Add 
the garlic and cook for another minute. Put the beef back in the pot, and mix in the coffee, 
the beer, two cups of water, bacon crumbles and the dry spices. Turn the heat up to high.

Your soaking chiles should be soft by now. Drain them and discard the soaking water (it will 
be bitter) and place them in a blender along with the canned chipotle chiles and one cup of 
fresh water. Puree until nice and smooth and then add the chile puree to the chili pot.

When chili begins to boil, turn heat down to low and let simmer for five hours, stirring 
occasionally. Taste it once an hour, and if the flavors are too muted, feel free to add more 
of any of the spices. Also, it starts to get too dry, add more liquid (your choice!).

After five hours, take a Mexican hot chocolate disc, and finely grate 1/3 of it into the pot. 
Scoop out 1 cup of broth and add the masa harina. Mix it well and then reincorporate it back 
into the pot. Stir until chili is thickened.

Let the chili simmer for another half hour or so. When done, serve with cheddar, onions and 
tortillas.

Note: If you can't find all of these chiles, I would just use the more readily available anchos 
and chipotles. I'd use 6-8 anchos, following the same soaking and pureeing method, and two chipotles.

Chimichurri Sauce

    1/4 cup hot water
    2 teaspoons dried oregano
    2 teaspoons kosher salt
    1 1/3 cups loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
    2/3 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves
    6 medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)
    1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
    1/4 cup red wine vinegar
    1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Combine hot water, oregano, and salt in small bowl; let stand 5 minutes 
to soften oregano. Pulse parsley, cilantro, garlic, and red pepper flakes in food 
processor until coarsely chopped, about ten 1-second pulses. Add water mixture and 
vinegar and pulse briefly to combine. Transfer mixture to medium bowl and slowly whisk 
in oil until incorporated and mixture is emulsified. Cover with plastic wrap and let 
stand at room temperature at least 1 hour (if preparing sauce in advance, refrigerate 
and bring to room temperature before using).


Chimichurri Sauce 2

    1 cup firmly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, trimmed of thick stems
    3-4 garlic cloves
    2 Tbsps fresh oregano leaves (can sub 2 teaspoons dried oregano)
    1/2 cup olive oil

    1 teaspoon sea salt
    1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
	
Finely chop the parsley, fresh oregano, and garlic (or process in a food processor several pulses). Place in a small bowl.
Stir in the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Adjust seasonings.

Notes: Very good with steak, extreme garlic flavor!



Creole Garlic Dip/Mayo
2 cup or so of mayo in a bowl. 
4 or 5 cloves of garlic, minced

This is the base of the recipe and you can really go anywhere from here. The garlic makes 
the mayo a bit spicy. From there, I will had a few dashes of Tony Chachere, or you can 
use paprika, garlic powder, lemon pepper, chili powder, red pepper (flakes or powder) -- 
to taste. Don't go overboard with the salt, though. You can get even more fancy with 
minced parsley. Paprika gives you these pretty little red "dots". You can also add in a 
little mustard (ground, or yellow). This goes great on a sandwich, to dip artichoke 
into, on BBQ as an alternative to bbq sauce, seafood, etc.


Teriyaki Sauce:

1 part Soy Sauce
1 part Sugar
1 part Mirin

vs.

Teriyaki Marinade

1 1/4  1 1/2 pounds either rib eye steak cut into 1/4? thick slices or chicken thighs
1 cup soy sauce
2/3 cup sugar
1" piece of ginger, smashed, and sliced
2 large (or 3 medium) cloves of garlic, smashed and sliced
1 stalk of green onion (white and green parts), chopped

Stir all ingredients together in a dish that is large enough for marinating (I use an 
  8" x 8" glass Pyrex). Add the meat and marinate between one and three hours. Grill meat. 



Sweet and Spicy Chicken Drumsticks

    1/2 cup Sriracha
    1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
    1/4 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
    1/4 cup red currant or strawberry jelly
    12 large chicken drumsticks
    Kosher salt
    1 cup rice flour
    1 tablespoon cornstarch

Bring Sriracha, rice vinegar, mirin, and jelly to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over high heat. 
Reduce heat to medium; simmer, adjusting heat if necessary, until mixture is thick and reduced to 
3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.

Place drumsticks in a large bowl and season generously with salt. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
Preheat oven to 450°F. Whisk rice flour and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Place a wire rack on a 
rimmed baking sheet. Using a paper towel, pat drumsticks dry. Dredge in rice flour mixture, shaking 
off excess. Arrange on prepared rack.

Roast drumsticks, turning frequently, until skin is browned and crisp, 50-60 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can 
be made 1 day ahead. Let cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm in a 450°F oven for 10-15 minutes before 
continuing.

Combine hot drumsticks and 1/4 cup sauce in a large bowl; toss to coat. Return drumsticks to rack 
and roast, turning once, until skin is crisp and sauce is beginning to brown, 8-9 minutes. Brush 
with additional sauce and serve remaining sauce alongside.


Slow Cooker Lamb Curry

11/2 Pds of Cooked Lamb
1 Onion, Chopped
2 Cups of Broth (Beef or Chicken)
6 Oz. of Mushrooms, Chopped
2 Tbsp of Curry
1 Tbsp of Rosemary
2 Cloves of Garlic
2 Tbsp of Butter
2 Tbsp of Olive Oil
1 Tbsp of Garam Masala
1 tsp of Ginger
1 tsp of Salt
1/2 tsp of Fennel
1 Tbsp of Oregano
2 Large Baking Potatoes, Cubed
1 Can of Tomato Paste
1 Bunch of Cilantro, Chopped
1/2 Cup of Plain Yogurt

Pull out your slow cooker and add everything into the pot with the exception of the yogurt.
Turn on your pot, setting it on low for the next 4-6 hours or high for the next 3-5.  
Walk away and dont look back until its time for dinner.
When the magic hour arrives, cook up a batch of rice and while thats in progress, youll 
simply open up your slow cooker, grab your yogurt and stir it into the curry.



Homemade tortillas

3 cups flour 1 cup water 1/3 cup vegetable oil (or corn, canola, etc) 1/2 tsp salt

Mix into a big dough ball. Tear off 2-3 in chunks and roll into balls. I usually get 8 to 10 
tortilla balls off one batch. Flour your workspace and roll out the tortilla balls to desired 
thickness. When they are all rolled out, toss them on a griddle one at a time. You want them 
to have golden brown spots. They will bubble a little.



Fish Tacos
   
    1 pound firm white fish, such as tilapia, snapper, cod, mahi mahi, or catfish
    2 limes, halved
    1 garlic clove, minced
    1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/4 teaspoon chili powder
    2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates
    Kosher salt
    Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 small head of green or red cabbage (about 14 ounces), cored and thinly sliced
    1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
    1/4 cup cilantro, coarsely chopped
    6 to 8 soft (6-inch) corn tortillas
    Sliced avocado, for garnish (optional)
    Guacamole, for garnish (optional)
    Salsa, for garnish (optional)
    Sour cream, for garnish (optional)
    Hot sauce, for garnish (optional)

Place the fish in a baking dish and squeeze a lime half over it. Add the garlic, cumin, chili 
  powder, and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Season with salt and pepper and turn the fish in the 
  marinade until evenly coated. Refrigerate and let marinate at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, 
  make the slaw and warm the tortillas.
Combine the cabbage, onion, and cilantro in a large bowl and squeeze a lime half over it. Drizzle 
  with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Taste 
  and add more salt and pepper if necessary; set aside.
Warm the tortillas in a heated medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Wrap the warm tortillas 
  in a clean dishcloth and set aside while you prepare the fish.
Brush the grates of a grill pan or outdoor grill with oil and heat over medium-high heat until 
  hot. Remove the fish from the marinade and place on the grill.
Cook without moving until the underside of the fish has grill marks and is white and opaque on 
  the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and grill the other side until white and opaque, about 2 to 
  3 minutes more. (Its OK if it breaks apart while youre flipping.) Transfer the fish to a plate.
Taste the slaw again and season as needed with more lime juice. Slice the remaining lime halves 
  into wedges and serve with the tacos. To construct a taco, break up some of the cooked fish, 
  place it in a warm tortilla, and top it with slaw and any optional garnishes.


Fish Tacos

For Sauce:
1 cup plain yogurt
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon honey

For Fish:
1 lime, juiced
3 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper, to taste
1 cup flour
2 4-6oz. mahi mahi fillets, sliced into 1/2 thick pieces
vegetable oil

1 cup cabbage, any color, shredded
Small flour tortillas
Chopped cilantro, lime wedges, and sliced green onions for garnish.

Directions
Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

In a shallow dish, stir together lime juice, honey, and spices. Add fish slices and toss to coat. 
Let marinate for 10-15 minutes.

You can season your flour with more spice if youd like. Take fish out of marinade and lightly toss 
in flour. Shake off excess.

Heat a few tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Add coated fish pieces and cook until golden and 
cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side (will vary depending on how you sliced your fish).

Heat tortillas in a small pan until warm and bubbly. Keep in a warm oven until ready to serve. 
Top with fish, cabbage, cilantro, green onion, and yogurt sauce. Enjoy! 



Russian Cabbage Soup

    1 1/2 pounds ground lean beef
    1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
    1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
    4 cubes beef bouillon
    2 medium carrots, shredded
    1 onion, chopped
    2 tablespoons white vinegar (or more to taste)
    1/4 cup white sugar (originally 1/2 cup)
    1 1/2 teaspoons salt
    1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
    2 quarts water, divided
    3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    1 head cabbage, cored and cut into wedges

Crumble the ground beef into a large pot. Brown with carrot and onion.
Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef bouillon cubes, vinegar, sugar, 
salt and pepper. Pour in 1 quart of water, and bring to a boil. 
Once the soup comes to a boil, cover and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat.
Pour in another quart of water, and return to a slow boil. Add garlic and cabbage. 
Simmer for 25 minutes, until cabbage is tender. Ladle into soup bowls to serve.

Notes: Very good! It's like having stuffed cabbage roll soup without the rice.
We liked it with quite a bit more vinegar (probably 6 tablespoons) and only a small
amount of sugar (probably 1.5 tablespoons). I think a slightly larger can of tomato
sauce would have helped thicken the base better. I only had half a head of cabbage
so I threw a bunch of kale in; it worked great.



Hungarian Chicken Paprikash (Csirkepaprikás)

    2 chicken legs
    1 tablespoon butter
    1 large onion (or two small onions), roughly chopped
    1 white pepper (I used a green pepper instead), chopped
    [optional] 1 roma tomato, chopped
    2 tablespoons paprika (Hungarian sweet paprika preferred)
    1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
    1 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    3/4 cup chicken stock
    1/4 cup sour cream

    In a heated pan, add butter, and swirl the butter around the pan.
    When the butter starts to brown, add the chicken pieces, skin side down onto the pan.
    Turn the chicken pieces over when they start to brown, and cook the other side until brown as well.
    When the chicken is brown on all sides, remove from the pan, but save the drippings.

	To the remaining butter/chicken fat mixture, add the chopped onions and fry them.
    When the onions are soft and slightly transparent, add the green pepper and tomato to the pan.
    Continue frying, and make sure nothing gets burnt.

	When the vegetables are soft, add the paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper to the pan.
    Fry the vegetables with the seasoning until evenly combined.
    Add the chicken pieces back to the pan, then add the chicken stock.
    Bring the contents of the pan to a boil, then cover, and set the heat on low.
    Simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken pieces are cooked and the juices run clear.
	
	When the chicken is cooked, remove the chicken and place the chicken on top your choice of starch. 
	(I used Hungarian dumplings or nokedli. Recipe below.)
    Turn off the heat, and let the vegetables cool down for 5 minutes.
    After 5 minutes, add the sour cream to the pan, and stir to combine.
    Spoon the sauce over the chicken and nokedli, and serve.

	Notes: Wait, 2 chicken legs? That can't be right!
	
	
Hungarian Dumplings (Nokedli)

    1 cup flour
    2 eggs
    1/4 cup plain yoghut or sour cream
    pinch of salt

    Add all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, and mix with a spatula until a soft dough is formed.

    [Traditionally, the nokedli is made using a nokedli press, or by hand. Unfortunately, I'm too 
	lazy to do each tiny piece of nokedli individually, and do not want to eat dinner the next morning, 
	so I decided to use a shortcut by squeezing the dough through a strainer. A nokedli press is 
	similar to a potato ricer, so that would perfectly as well, but I don't own one.]
    Add water to a pot and bring it to a simmer.
    Press and squeeze the dough through a strainer, and into the simmering water.
    Remove the nokedli pieces when they start to float.
    You now have nokedli for your Chicken Paprikash, or just to fry with some salt, pepper and cheese.
	

Piroshki

    1 1/2 pounds ground beef
    1 onion, finely chopped
    1 teaspoon salt
    ground black pepper to taste
    dried dill weed to taste
     
    1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
    1/4 cup warm water
    1 cup milk
    3 eggs
    1/2 cup vegetable oil
    2 tablespoons granulated sugar
    1 teaspoon salt
    4 cups all-purpose flour
    3 cups oil for frying

    In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until evenly browned; drain. 
	Stir in the onion and cook with the beef until translucent. Sprinkle in salt, pepper and 
	dill weed to taste. Allow to cool before using.
    
	Dissolve the yeast in the 1/4 cup of warm water and place in a warm location until frothy, 
	about 10 to 15 minutes. In a medium saucepan over low heat, warm the milk and gently whisk 
	in the eggs, oil, sugar and salt. Remove from heat.
	
    Place half the flour in a large mixing bowl and gradually stir in the milk mixture. Then add 
	the yeast solution alternately with the remaining flour, stirring after each addition. Mix well. 
	Knead until the dough forms a ball and does not stick to the bowl. (Note: Start with the 4 cups 
	of flour. You may need to add more, a little at a time, as you knead the dough). Cover the bowl 
	with a clean cloth. Set in a warm location and allow to rise until doubled in volume.
	
    Remove dough from bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Pinch off pieces approximately 
	the size of golf balls. Roll the pieces into disks about 3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter.
	
    Fill center of each disk with a heaping tablespoon of the cooled meat mixture. Fold disks over 
	the mixture and firmly pinch edges to seal. Arrange on a flat surface and allow to sit approximately 
	10 minutes.
	
    In an large, heavy skillet or deep fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Deep fry 
	the piroshki in batches until golden brown on one side; gently turn and fry the other side. 
	Remove and let drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

	Note: Reviewers of this recipe reported baking the piroshki at 400F for 15-20 minutes rather than frying.

Easy Homemade Spaghetti Sauce

    2 large cans of Hunts tomato puree
    2 26 oz cans whole, stewed tomatoes (in juice)
    1 small can tomato puree
    1 large yellow onion, diced
    3-4 cloves garlic, minced
    Olive oil
    Parmesan cheese
    2-4 tablespoons butter.
    Salt and pepper
    Fresh basil if you can.

Sautee your onions and garlic in olive oil on medium heat until translucent. Add about 1-2 tablespoons of 
the tomato paste and cook another 2 minutes. Add the whole tomatoes with the juice and turn the heat medium 
high. Stir occasionally for the next 4 minutes. Add tomato sauce, bring to just about a boil on medium-high 
heat and then lower heat super low and simmer for about 30 minutes.

Cook your favorite pasta variety and save about 1/2 cup of the pasta water. At this point you'll want to 
season your sauce with salt and pepper (and crushed red pepper if you are like me).

Add your water, butter, a nice handful of the parmesan cheese, and a good 1/4 cup of olive oil to the sauce 
and stir to mix. Add some chopped fresh basil (you can get it super cheap at the farmer's market) and toss 
with your pasta. Serve immediately with some garlic bread.


Shakshuka

    1 tbsp olive oil
    1/2 medium brown or white onion, peeled and diced
    1 clove garlic, minced
    1 medium green or red bell pepper, chopped
    4 cups ripe diced tomatoes, or 2 cans (14 oz. each) diced tomatoes
    2 tbsp tomato paste
    1 tsp chili powder (mild)
    1 tsp cumin
    1 tsp paprika
    Pinch of cayenne pepper (or more to taste-- spicy!)
    Pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)
    Salt and pepper to taste
    5-6 eggs
    1/2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)

Heat a deep, large skillet or sauté pan on medium. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, sauté 
for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to sauté till mixture is fragrant. 

Add the bell pepper, sauté for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.

Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir till blended. Add spices and sugar, stir well, and allow mixture to 
simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes till it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and 
spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more 
cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka.

Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the 
sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook "over easy" style 
on top of the tomato sauce.

Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly 
reduced. Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired. 

Notes: Good! I used picante paprika and skipped the cayenne. I did not add any sugar and we did not miss it. This
is a very good dinner.


Hungarian Mushroom Soup

    4 tablespoons unsalted butter
    2 cups chopped onions
    1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced

    ground black pepper to taste
    2 teaspoons lemon juice
    1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 cup sour cream

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onions in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms 
and saute for 5 more minutes. Stir in the dill, paprika, soy sauce and broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 
for 15 minutes.
In a separate small bowl, whisk the milk and flour together. Pour this into the soup and stir well to blend. Cover 
and simmer for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Finally, stir in the salt, ground black pepper, lemon juice, parsley and sour cream. Mix together and allow to heat 
through over low heat, about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not boil. Serve immediately.

Notes: Excellent! I used fresh dill and it worked very well.

Baked Scotch Eggs

Eggs (approx 5 for a pound of sausage)
Breakfast sausage
Salt
Sage
Pepper
Thyme
Flour
Panko bread crumbs (or any bread crumbs would do, really)

Hard boil eggs. To the sausage, add a dash of salt, sage, pepper, and thyme (about 1/2 tsp each) Split 
the meat into equal parts, and flatten them out, kind of like a thin patty. Peel the eggs, then dip the 
egg in water, and then in flour. Then wrap the sausage around the egg. THEN, beat an egg in a bowl, dip the 
sausage egg in the beaten egg, then roll the sausage egg in panko crumbs.

Bake on a cookie sheet at 400 for 30 minutes.

    2 medium tomatoes, chopped
    1/2-1 tsp roasted cumin powder (as per taste)
    juice of 1 lemon along with zest, as per taste
    some cane sugar for sprinkling
    salt to taste
    few sprigs of cilantro for garnish

Add all the vegetables together. Squeeze the lemon juice.
Add the spices (cumin, salt and sugar)
Toss them well together.  Do a taste test to see if the seasoning is right for you. Better to start with 
little seasoning and build it along the way. Cover with plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator. 
This sitting time helps the flavors to blend.

Note: Great! An excellent summer salad.

Cook's Notes: Increase to 2 cucumbers. Use juice of a lime instead of lemon. Be fairly liberal with the salt. 
Be very conservative with the sugar (just a pinch is enough). Chop some cilantro and mix it into the salad.
Hot peppers are truly optional depending on whether the dish needs to help cool down other spicy foods or
provide a spicy balance to sweeter or richer foods. If used, de-seed then slice thinly or dice finely.




Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya

 3 boneless chicken breasts (1.5-2lbs)
 1 lb. of smoked andouille sausage
 3 bell peppers (red, orange, and yellow)
 2 medium yellow onions
 2 jalapenos
 3 cups chicken broth
 3 cups water
 3 cups medium-grain white rice
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
 2 teaspoons salt
 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning (I prefer Tony Chacheres)
 3 bay leaves

    Put 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil into medium dutch oven, and heat on medium heat. o I use a 4qt dutch oven and everything fits perfectly.
    Dice up the bell peppers, onions, and jalapenos, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and throw them in the pot. These should cook about 18-20 minutes. o I dice up all of my veggies in a food processor.
    Dice up the sausage into bite-sized pieces and throw them in the pot. These should cook about 15 minutes. o Make sure you scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen up any browned particles.
    Add 3 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water to a small saucepan and heat on medium-high heat.
    Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, cover with 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning, and throw into the pot. Also, add the 3 bay leaves to the pot. The chicken should take about 8-10 minutes to cook through.
    Add 3 cups of medium-grain white rice to the pot and stir to combine. Stir for a few minutes to let the rice soak up the juices in the pot.
    By this point, the broth/water pot should be boiling, add the liquid to the dutch oven and stir a few times.
    Put the lid on the dutch oven and turn the heat to low and let sit for about 40 minutes. It is very important that you not take the lid off during this time, or the rice will not cook correctly.
    Take the lid and off stir to mix the jambalaya, since most of the meat will have floated to the top.
    Remove the 3 bay leaves and serve!

Boston Baked Beans

    2 cups navy beans
    1/2 pound bacon
    1 onion, finely diced
    3 tablespoons molasses
    2 teaspoons salt
    1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
    1/2 cup ketchup
    1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions

    Soak beans overnight in cold water. Simmer the beans in the same water until tender, 
	  approximately 1 to 2 hours. Drain and reserve the liquid.
    Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
    Arrange the beans in a 2 quart bean pot or casserole dish by placing a portion of the beans in the bottom of dish, and layering them with bacon and onion.
    In a saucepan, combine molasses, salt, pepper, dry mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. 
	Bring the mixture to a boil and pour over beans. Pour in just enough of the reserved bean water to cover the beans. 
	Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
    Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until beans are tender. 
	Remove the lid about halfway through cooking, and add more liquid if necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry.

Sauerbraten

This is the best sauerbraten recipe. The meat is more tender, and flavorful the longer you marinade, I usually marinade for 2 days

INGREDIENTS:

3 pounds bottom round roast
1 cup red wine vinegar
1 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 bay leaves
3 whole cloves
2 tablespoons salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tomato, cut into wedges

DIRECTIONS:

Place meat in large, non-metal bowl. In separate bowl, combine red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, lemon juice, onion, bay leaves, cloves, 
salt and pepper. Pour over meat. Cover and refrigerate 48 hours.

Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove meat from marinade and brown in oil on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes a side. 
Remove bay leaves and cloves from marinade. Pour in 1 cup water and pour marinade into pan with meat. 
Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 3 hours, or until tender.

Remove meat from pan. Increase heat and sprinkle flour, a little at a time, over juices, cooking until mixture thickens to form gravy. 
Return meat to pan with tomato wedges, heat through and serve.



Thai Basil Chicken

3 garlic cloves, chopped
1/4 red bell pepper, cut into thin 1? pieces
1 1/2 TB fish sauce

1 TB brown sugar (packed) or agave nectar
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2-2/3 cup basil (lightly packed) OR ~12 large leaves Thai basil
canola oil for the pan

Make the sauce by stirring together fish sauce, tamari, brown sugar/agave, 1-2 tsp mirin (if using), and black pepper. Set it aside.

Heat a cast iron skillet (or other heavy-bottomed pan) over medium-high heat. Add about 1 TB of canola oil to the pan. Once the pan 
becomes hot, add shallots to the pan. Sauté for about a minute. Add garlic and chili to the pan. Continue stirring until shallots 
are lightly brown. Add chicken to the pan. Sauté for about 2 minutes until the chicken is almost cooked through. Add the red bell 
pepper pieces to the pan. Continue to stir until the chicken is cooked through.
    
Add the sauce to the pan. Mix well to ensure that the sauce is well distributed. Turn the heat off once the pan is dry. Add the basil

Sweet Potato Casserole

4 cups sweet potato, cubed
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup chopped pecans

1. 	Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan with water to cover. 
    Cook over medium high heat until tender; drain and mash.
2. 	In a large bowl, mix together the sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, salt, butter, milk and vanilla extract. 
    Mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
3. 	In medium bowl, mix the brown sugar and flour. Cut in the butter until the mixture is coarse. Stir in the pecans. 
    Sprinkle the mixture over the sweet potato mixture.
4. 	Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until the topping is lightly brown.

Notes: Ye gods this is sweet. Probably should reduce white sugar to 1/3 cup. Also, do not feel compelled to sprinkle
entire brown sugar/flour/butter/nut topping on the casserole because it's just too much. I substituted black walnuts
for pecans and it was ok but the bitterness/bite of the walnuts did not match very well with the overwhelming sweetness
of the casserole. I wanted to make this dish at least once and I feel like that's probably enough. :-) Somebody else can
roll the dice against diabetes - I'll make an Indian or Moroccan dish out of my surplus sweet potatoes next time!



Brazilian Black Bean Stew

1 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 pound chorizo sausage, chopped
1/3 pound cooked ham, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (1 pound) sweet potatoes, peeled and diced

2 (16 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 mango - peeled, seeded and diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 teaspoon salt

1. 	Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the chorizo and ham 2 to 3 minutes. Place the onion in the pot, 
    and cook until tender. Stir in garlic, and cook until tender, then mix in the sweet potatoes, bell pepper, tomatoes 
	with juice, chile pepper, and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, until sweet 
	potatoes are tender.
2. 	Stir the beans into the pot, and cook uncovered until heated through. Mix in the mango and cilantro, and season with salt.



Sweet Potato, Carrot, Apple, and Red Lentil Soup

1/4 cup butter
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and
chopped
3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup red lentils
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4 cups vegetable broth
plain yogurt

1. 	Melt the butter in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Place the chopped sweet potatoes, 
    carrots, apple, and onion in the pot. Stir and cook the apples and vegetables until the onions are 
	translucent, about 10 minutes.
2. 	Stir the lentils, ginger, ground black pepper, salt, cumin, chili powder, paprika, and vegetable broth 
    into the pot with the apple and vegetable mixture. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat, then reduce 
	the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils and vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes.
3. 	Working in batches, pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold 
    down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few 
	quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and 
	pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking 
	pot.
4. 	Return the pureed soup to the cooking pot. Bring back to a simmer over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes. 
    Add water as needed to thin the soup to your preferred consistency. Serve with yogurt for garnish.

Harissa

2 Tbsp. whole coriander seeds
2 Tbsp. whole cumin seeds
2 Tbsp. dried crushed red chile pepper (more if you can take it, less if wuss )
2 garlic cloves
1/2 squeezed lemon
3-4-5 Tbsp olive oil (until it's a nice paste, like grainy mustard)
Salt to taste

1) Grind the spices thoroughly in a mortar and pestle. (adding some salt when grinding makes it easier)
2) Add cloves, pound until a thick paste.
3) Add the Lemon juice, Olive oil until it's a nice goo, salt to taste.


Pumpkin and Sausage Soup

1 pound tube of HOT sausage
1 Medium Onion Chopped
1-2 Cloves of Garlic Chopped
8 ounces of Fresh Mushrooms sliced
1 rounded Tablespoon of Italian spices
1  15 ounce can of Pumpkin Puree (NOT pumpkin pie filling)
4 cups Chicken Broth 
1 cup Half & Half (or milk)

Brown sausage. Drain fat. Add onion, garlic, mushroom and Italian spices. 
Cook until onion is translucent. Add pumpkin/squash, mix well; add broth. 
Add salt and pepper. Simmer 20 minutes. Add milk, gently simmer a few minutes more and serve.

Notes: This is really good! I used a real pumpkin instead of canned. Didn't really change anything
else except I didn't bother measuring the pumpkin.


Creamy Kohlrabi Soup

    2 tablespoons butter
    1 medium onion, chopped
    1 pound kohlrabi bulbs, peeled and chopped
    2 1/2 cups vegetable stock
    2 1/2 cups milk
    1 bay leaf
    Salt and black pepper

 Melt butter in a large pan with a lid. Add onions and cook gently until soft, about 10 minutes. 
 Add kohlrabi and cook 2 minutes. Add vegetable stock, milk and bay leaf to pan, and bring to a boil. 
 Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 25 minutes or until kohlrabi is tender. Let cool a few minutes 
   and remove bay leaf.
 Using an immersion blender or conventional blender or food processor, puree soup until smooth. You 
   may want to strain the soup through a fine sieve if the kohlrabi is especially fibrous. Season to 
   taste with salt and pepper. Serve in heated bowls with hearty bread of choice.

Notes: Quite different from our usual fare but good. In our opinion the bay leaf and salt/pepper just
was not enough to provide a flavourful experience so we added some sweet (not smokey) paprika and a touch
of white pepper. This was a good combination and made the soup a bit warmer and more enjoyable.   
   
   
Braised Kohlrabi
   
    2 tablespoons butter
    3 to 4 medium kohlrabi
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 cup chicken broth, or to cover
    1 tablespoon lemon juice
    Salt and pepper, to taste

Preparation:
Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Slice kohlrabi into thin strips. Saute kohlrabi 
in the butter with garlic for about 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken broth and lemon juice. Cover and simmer 
for 20 minutes, or until kohlrabi is tender. Add salt and pepper, to taste.


Vietnamese Daikon and Carrot Pickles

Ingredients

    2 pounds carrots (about 5 medium sized carrots), peeled
    2 pounds of daikon radishes (about 2 large daikon), peeled
    1 cup plus 4 teaspoons of sugar
    2 teaspoons salt
    2 1/2 cups white vinegar
    2 cups warm water (warm enough to easily dissolve sugar)

    About 5 pint jars
	
1 Julienne the carrots and the daikon radishes. Cut them first crosswise into 2 1/2 inch long segments. 
  Then cut 1/4-inch thick slices lengthwise. Stack the slices and cut them again into 1/4-inch thick batons.
2 Place the carrots and daikon radishes in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 4 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons 
  of salt. Use your clean hands to toss the carrots and daikon with the salt and sugar until well coated. 
  Continue to mix the carrots and daikon with your hands until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. 
  They are ready once you can bend a piece of daikon all the way over without it breaking.
3 Transfer the carrots and daikon to a colander, rinse with cool water and drain well.
4 In a bowl (a 8 cup pyrex measuring cup works great for this) mix together one cup of sugar, the white 
  vinegar and the warm water, until the sugar dissolves.
5 Prepare clean jars. Pack the daikon and carrots tightly into the jars. Pour over the pickling liquid 
  to cover. Seal. Refrigerate.

The pickles should sit at least overnight before eating; their flavor will improve with time. They should 
last 4 to 6 weeks in the refrigerator.
Traditionally served in Vietnamese street sandwiches called Banh Mi. These pickles would be great with anything 
that would typically be served with coleslaw or sauerkraut, like hot dogs, or barbecued pork, or even with salad 
or wrapped into a spring roll. Or just eat them straight.

 
Southern Turnip Supreme

    1 cup vegetable broth
    3 cups peeled, cubed turnips
    1/4 cup minced onion
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    salt and black pepper to taste
    1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
    1/2 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
    chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Place the vegetable bouillon cube into a saucepan with the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. 
Cook until the bouillon cube dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in the turnips, onion, and garlic, return 
to a boil, and cook the mixture until the turnips are tender, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to a 
simmer, and cook until most of the liquid has been evaporated, 10 to 15 more minutes.
Lightly stir in the sour cream to coat the turnips. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and top with shredded 
Cheddar cheese and parsley.


Kashmiri-Style Kidney Beans with Turnips

    2 turnips, peeled and cubed
    1 cup water
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 (14.5 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
    3 tablespoons vegetable oil
    1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seeds
    1/2 teaspoon whole fennel seeds
    1 cup finely chopped red onion
    1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
    1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
    1 cup chopped tomatoes
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 teaspoon paprika
    1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
    1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
    2 tablespoons water
    1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri garam masala

Place turnips into a saucepan with the water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat 
to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the turnip is soft, about 5 minutes. Once tender, stir in the kidney beans, 
and cook 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the cumin and fennel, and cook until 
the spices toast and become fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the onion, and cook until it turns golden brown, about 
5 minutes. Stir in the minced ginger and garlic, cook and stir for 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes and salt, and 
continue cooking until the mixture turns pasty. Finally, stir in the paprika, turmeric, ground ginger, and 2 
tablespoons water; cook 2 minutes more.
Add the tomato mixture to the turnips, and simmer 10 minutes. Season with garam masala before serving.

Notes: Very good! Nice balance of spices - the fennel and cumin seed add great flavor.


Kale and Feta Salad

1 bunch kale, large stems discarded,
leaves finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 apple, diced
1/3 cup feta cheese
1/4 cup currants
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts

Massage kale with salt in a large mixing bowl for 2 minutes. 
Pour vinegar over the kale and toss to coat. 
Fold apple, feta cheese, currants, and pine nuts into the kale.

Notes: Simple and good. I used sliced almonds instead of pine nuts to good effect. At the end I decided we wanted
a little more feta, a splash more of vinegar and a quick drizzle of olive oil.



Napa Cabbage Slaw

    1 lime, juiced
    3 tablespoons rice vinegar
    2 tablespoons Asian chili oil
    1 tablespoon mayonnaise
    1 tablespoon soy sauce
    3 cups finely shredded napa cabbage
    1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
    1 orange bell pepper, thinly sliced
    1/2 cup thinly sliced snow peas
    3 scallions, thinly sliced
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Whisk together the lime juice, vinegar, chili oil, mayonnaise and soy sauce in a large bowl. 
Add the cabbage, peppers, snow peas and scallions and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. 
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

Notes: A nice Asian-style coleslaw. Watch out with the chili oil - we cut it to 1 T and it was still pretty
firey. Also, with 3 cups of shredded cabbage you don't really need two sliced bell peppers. Once seemed to
be enough.


COLLEGE CORN DIP

2 (15-ounce) cans Southwest Mexicorn with sweet peppers, drained
1 (4-ounce) can diced roasted green chilies, drained
1 (4-ounce) can diced jalapenos, drained
2 green onions (scallions), finely chopped
3/4 c. light mayonnaise
2/3 c. light sour cream
2 c. sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.  Chill, covered, for several hours or overnight to allow flavors to intensify.
Serve with corn chips in scoop shapes.
Keeps well in the refrigerator (covered) for 4-5 days.  Stir before serving. 

Notes: A good corn/cream cheese dip to have with chips or maybe on tacos.


Chicken Cacciatore Bake
 
    1 14-16oz box of Penne pasta
    1/2 cup diced onion
    3 cup cooked, diced chicken
    1 can diced tomatoes {undrained}
    1 can tomato sauce {14-16 oz}
    1 can chicken broth
    1 can sliced mushrooms {I'm not a huge fan of canned mushrooms, but I don't always have fresh on hand!}
    1 diced bell pepper {I use a yellow one}
    1/2 tsp dried oregano
    1/4 tsp dried basil
    salt & pepper to taste- I always shake a little on it
    1/2 tsp minced garlic {1 clove}
    1/2 cup Parmesan cheese

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a 9x13 pan with cooking spray.

Add all ingredients except for the Parmesan cheese to the pan. Stir to combine.
Cover the entire pan tightly with foil that's been sprayed with cooking spray on the underside. 
The noodles have to cook, so you need the heat to stay trapped in the pan.

After 30 minutes, remove from the oven and stir. Cover pasta with cheese and replace foil. Cook for another 30 minutes.


TIMPANO - EGGPLANT WRAPPED PASTA
http://www.instructables.com/id/TIMPANOEGGPLANT-WRAPPED-PASTA/?ALLSTEPS
It looks yummy. You mix zitti or rigatoni with veggies and cheese and tomato sauce, then
put it on top of roasted eggplant slices that have been draped inside a springform pan. More
eggplant goes on top to complete the 'pie' and you bake it. Looks like a bit of work but very 
interesting!



Warm Scallop Salad with Prosciutto Chips

    4 paper-thin slices prosciutto
    6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
    1 5-ounce package mixed babygreens
    1/2 cup (packed) fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced
    12 sea scallops
    All purpose flour
    2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
    1 teaspoon grated lemon peel

Brush each prosciutto slice on 1 side lightly with some of oil. Heat heavy large nonstick skillet 
over medium-high heat. Add 2 slices prosciutto, oiled side down. Cook until bottom is lightly browned, 
about 3 minutes. Turn prosciutto over and cook until bottom is browned, flattening with spatula, about 
1 minute longer. Using tongs, transfer prosciutto to paper towels to crisp. Repeat with remaining 2 
slices prosciutto. Reserve skillet.

Place greens and basil in large bowl. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper; dust lightly with flour. 
Heat remaining oil in reserved skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallops and cook until brown and just 
opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Add lemon juice and lemon peel to drippings 
in skillet. Bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Pour pan juices over greens and toss to coat. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide salad among 4 plates and top with scallops. Garnish with 
prosciutto chips and serve. 

Notes: Really good and different! We had some bacon chips instead of prosciutto - I think IMO I'd prefer 
bacon bits sprinkled over the salad rather than having a chip next to it. The lemon is an important aspect
of the dish; it adds an essential acid element to the dish and also provides an important citrus background.


Puebla-Style Chicken Mole

1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup thinly sliced onion
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 stemmed dried seeded ancho chiles, torn into 2-inch pieces (about 1/4 cup)

Thumbprint Cookies

    1 1/2 cups butter, softened
    1 cup sugar
    3 egg yolks
    3 cups sifted flour, or more
    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
    strawberry or raspberry jam

Cream butter and sugar together. Add egg yolks, flour and vanilla; mix well. If dough is too soft to handle, work 
in little more flour. Roll dough into little balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Make a thumb print in the 
center of each. Fill thumbprint with your favorite jam. Bake a small first batch, and if the cookies in the first 
batch spreads too much, work a little more flour into the dough. Bake at 400° for 8 to 10 minutes, until light 
brown around edges.
Makes 8-10 dozen cookies.


Chocolate and Candy Cane Cookies

1 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
chocolate chips
6-8 peppermint candy canes
	
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixer bowl, beat butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together until light and fluffy. 
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together, then add to the wet mixture, mixing until well 
blended. Stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto un-greased cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.

Next, smash your candy canes to smithereens. You can try to get a variety of sizes or you can just ground them into powder. 
Place in bowl.

Last, melt about 3/4 of a bag of chocolate chips. You can do this a few different ways. I put a glass bowl over a saucepan of 
boiling water.  Dip the cookies halfway into the chocolate, then dip them into the candy cane bowl. Set aside on foil or wax 
paper to harden.



Peppermint Meringues

2 egg whites
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
	
1/2 cup white sugar
2 peppermint candy canes, crushed
Directions:
1. 	Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with foil.
2. 	In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar, 
    continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Drop by spoonfuls 1 inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle 
	crushed peppermint candy over the cookies.
3. 	Bake for 1 1/2 hours in preheated oven. Meringues should be completely dry on the inside. Do not allow them to brown. 
    Turn off oven. Keep oven door ajar, and let meringues sit in the oven until completely cool. Loosen from foil with metal 
	spatula. Store loosely covered in cool dry place for up to 2 months.

8 oz butter
1 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
3 tsp baking powder
4 cups plain (all purpose) flour
1 lemon zested
1 tsp all spice (pimento)
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground cinnamon

preheat oven to 190C and grease/line a baking pan.  I used a 9x12 pan, but you can also make this in a loaf tin.

add honey, coffee, sugar, butter and spices to a saucepan and mix over a gentle heat until the sugar has dissolved 
and the butter melted.  Leave to cool for a while you prepare the other ingredients

break eggs into a bowl and add the lemon zest. Whisk for a few minutes until bubbly

slowly pour in the melted butter, sugar and honey mixture onto the whisked eggs and keep beating for a few minutes 
until fully incorporated. 
Be careful not to add the melted mixture too quickly as this may curdle the eggs

add sifted flour and baking powder to the wet mixture and stir well to incorporate
pour into greased baking tin

bake for 30-40 minutes - it is ready when a skewer/tooth pick comes out clean. 
leave to cool completely before cutting into squares
eat and share with your nearest and dearest :)

Notes: This is good but has too little spice to be a truly yummy ginger cake - we found it a little bland.


Aioli

3 dollops mayonnaise
1 T lemon juice
1 T minced garlic
pepper, cayenne (if desired)


Malt Vinegar Aioli

1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup malt vinegar (scant)
2 cloves garlic, mashed into paste
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, finely chopped
Salt& Pepper to taste

Notes: A wonderful condiment to have with fries or steamed shrimp.


Chicken with Brussels Sprouts and Mustard Sauce

2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3/8 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3/4 cup fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth, divided
1/4 cup unfiltered apple cider
2 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
12 ounces Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved

Preheat oven to 450°.

Heat a large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt 
and pepper; add to pan. Cook 3 minutes or until browned. Turn chicken; place pan in oven. Bake at 450° for 9 
minutes or until done. Remove chicken from pan; keep warm. 
Heat pan over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 cup broth and cider; bring to a boil, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. 
Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 4 minutes or until thickened. Whisk in mustard, 1 tablespoon butter, and parsley.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
Add Brussels sprouts; sauté 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Add remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup broth 
to pan; cover and cook 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Serve sprouts with chicken and sauce.

Notes: A great and very different dish. You probably want to double the sauce.
       Another item worth mentioning - you can cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and saute until cooked,
	    eliminating the baking step. The Brussels sprouts are superior roasted in the oven, as well.



Slow Cooker Creamy Chicken and Mint Curry

    4 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
    1 red onion, very finely diced
    1 tablespoon fresh ginger paste
    4 pods garlic, pressed
    1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
    1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
    1 teaspoon salt
    1 teaspoon sugar
    1 large tomato, diced
    2 pounds boneless chicken, cut into small pieces
    1/3 cup low fat sour cream
    1/2 cup cashew nuts
    3/4 cups loosely packed mint leaves
    1 large lime, halved
    2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
    3 green chiles, coarsely chopped

In a large non-stick skillet or pan heat the oil on medium heat for about 1 minute. 
Add in the onions and sauté well for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onions soften, wilt and begin the turn golden at the edges.
Add in the ginger paste and the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.
Add in the cumin and coriander powders and mix well.
Place the entire mixture in a slow cooker, add in the salt, sugar and the tomato and turn the setting on a high.
Let this cook undisturbed for 1 hour on high and add in the chicken and cook for another 45 minutes, until the mixture is bubbly and cooking briskly.
Place the sour cream and cashews in a blender and grind until smooth. Then, stir into the chicken and let it simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Place the mint in a blender, squeeze in the lime juice and add the cilantro and green chilies and grind to a paste.
At this point, the chicken should be soft and the gravy should be a light creamy texture.
Turn off the slow cooker and stir in the herb sauce and mix well. Let rest for 20 minutes before serving.



Ceviche

1 pound bay scallops
8 limes, juiced
2 tomatoes, diced
5 green onions, minced
2 stalks celery, sliced
	
1/2 green bell pepper, minced
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Rinse scallops and place in a medium sized bowl. 
Pour lime juice over the scallops. The scallops should be completely immersed in the lime juice. 
Chill the lime juice and scallops all day or overnight until scallops are opaque (you cannot see through them).
Empty 1/2 of the lime juice from the bowl. 
Add tomatoes, green onions, celery, green bell pepper, parsley, black pepper, olive oil, and cilantro to the scallop mixture. 
Stir gently. Serve.



Caponata

1 medium-large eggplant, cut into (approx) 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup olive oil
1 stalk of celery, chopped
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (I use a mix or red/orange/yellow when available)
1 medium onion, chopped
1(14oz) can diced tomatoes
3 tablespoons raisins
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoon drained capers (you can use olives in place of or in addition to capers)
1 fat garlic clove, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
Salt and pepper
1 loaf ciabatta bread, or other delicious rustic bread
Generous slices of fresh (water-packed) mozzarella (I use either one or two packages, depending upon how gluttonous I and my friends feel)

First cut up the eggplant and spread it out in a single layer over a clean flour cloth or a few layers of paper towel. 
Sprinkle it with salt all over (using about one rounded teaspoon to cover each eggplant), toss it around to coat all 
sides lightly and let it "sweat" for at least fifteen minutes. Don't worry; most of this salt will not go into the final dish.

Meanwhile, dice the onion and chop the celery and peppers to approx 1/2-inch pieces.
Measure out your other ingredients while you wait for the eggplant to sweat.

Cover eggplant with more towel and press it down, then roll it up and SQUEEZE out the water and salt as much as you can. 
Don't be gentle, at this stage the eggplant is simply a sponge, and the less water it has in it the better! It will plump 
up again and be saturated with deliciousness from all the other ingredients.

Once all your ingredients are laid out, heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat--careful not to get it too hot, 
olive oil scorches at a relatively low temperature.

Add the celery and fry about 2 minutes. Add half the onion and the eggplant and fry about 2 more minutes. Season with salt 
(about 1/2 tsp should be fine for one eggplant). Add the bell peppers and cook about 5 minutes. Add the remaining onion 
and fry until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes with their juices, raisins, and oregano. Season again 
with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer over medium-low heat until the flavors blend and the mixture thickens, stirring 
often, about 20 minutes. Add the vinegar, sugar, and capers (and/or olives). Season once more with salt and pepper, if needed.

Serve hot over pasta, as an open-faced warm sandwich over ciabatta bread or other toast, with fresh mozzarella if desired, 
or chill and serve the next day. I find this always taste better the next day so I usually try to make a double batch so 
there are plenty of left-overs to share.

Dolmades - Stuffed Grape Leaves
[From a Foodies Greek cooking class Jon and Kate attended in 2006]

Dolmades and Stuffing:
8 oz package/jar grape leaves preserved in brine, large stems trimmed
2/3 cup Arborio rice
pinch of salt
2 T olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/3 cup pine nuts
1/3 cup raisins or currants (J+K prefer currants)
3 scallions, finely chopped
1 T chopped fresh mint
1 T chopped fresh dill
2 T chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
salt and pepper

Simmering solution:
3/4 cup olive oil
juice of 1 lemon
2/3 cup water

Drain grape leaves, unroll and place in large bowl. Boil some water and add to bowl; soak 20 mins.
Drain bowl, soak leaves again in water for about 20 more minutes; drain again.
Cook rice according to package directions until tender.
Heat olive oil in skillet, sweat onion until soft and then add garlic. Cook about 1 minute more - do 
  not allow garlic to burn. Remove from heat and add pine nuts, raisins/currants, scallions, herbs and rice.
  Season with s&p.
Use only the nicest leaves you can find for stuffing. Discards can be used during the simmering process.
Place leaf on working surface vein side up. Place about 1 T filling in the center of the leaf. Fold up the bottom,
  then the sides inward (burrito folding style). Roll leaf and place seam side down on tray. Use light pressure - 
  you want the rolls firm and tight but not with the filling bulging out of the leaf.
Line the bottom of a large dutch oven/saute pan with the discarded grape leaves. Place rolled dolmades in the pot,
  seam side down. Pack them fairly closely so they can't move easily. It is ok to make more than one layer if necessary.
  Mix olive oil, lemon juice and water and pour into pot. Place a flame-proof plate over the dolmades to hold them in 
  place during cooking. Place on medium heat and simmer for 45 minutes or until the water is mostly absorbed/evaporated.

Serve warm or chilled. Excellent with tzatziki sauce, aioli, etc.

Notes: These are the best dolmades we've eaten, hands down. The fresh herbs, pine nuts and currants make them
very flavorful and savory, far superior to the plain white rice dolmades that are supermarket popular. They take a while
to make but are really worth the effort. Draft everybody within reach and it will go quickly!

Double Chocolate Layer Cake

For cake layers

    3 ounces fine-quality semisweet chocolate such as Callebaut
    1 1/2 cups hot brewed coffee
    3 cups sugar
    2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process)
    2 teaspoons baking soda
    3/4 teaspoon baking powder
    1 1/4 teaspoons salt
    3 large eggs
    3/4 cup vegetable oil
    1 1/2 cups well-shaken buttermilk
    3/4 teaspoon vanilla

For ganache frosting

    1 pound fine-quality semisweet chocolate such as Callebaut
    1 cup heavy cream
    2 tablespoons sugar
    2 tablespoons light corn syrup
    1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter

    two 10- by 2-inch round cake pans

Make cake layers:
Preheat oven to 300°F. and grease pans. Line bottoms with rounds of wax paper and grease paper.

Finely chop chocolate and in a bowl combine with hot coffee. Let mixture stand, stirring occasionally, 
until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.

Into a large bowl sift together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. 
In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat eggs until thickened slightly and lemon colored 
  (about 3 minutes with a standing mixer or 5 minutes with a hand-held mixer). 
Slowly add oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs, beating until combined well. 
Add sugar mixture and beat on medium speed until just combined well. Divide batter between pans and 
  bake in middle of oven until a tester inserted in center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Cool layers completely in pans on racks. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert layers onto racks. 
Carefully remove wax paper and cool layers completely. 
Cake layers may be made 1 day ahead and kept, wrapped well in plastic wrap, at room temperature.

Make frosting:
Finely chop chocolate. In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan bring cream, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil over 
  moderately low heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and add chocolate, 
  whisking until chocolate is melted. 
Cut butter into pieces and add to frosting, whisking until smooth.

Transfer frosting to a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until spreadable (depending on chocolate used, 
  it may be necessary to chill frosting to spreadable consistency).

Spread frosting between cake layers and over top and sides. 
Cake keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days. 
Bring cake to room temperature before serving.

	
Barbecue Pulled Chicken (Crockpot)	

    1 8-ounce can reduced-sodium tomato sauce
    1 4-ounce can chopped green chiles, drained
    3 tablespoons cider vinegar
    2 tablespoons honey
    1 tablespoon sweet or smoked paprika
    1 tablespoon tomato paste
    1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
    2 teaspoons dry mustard
    1 teaspoon ground chipotle chile
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat
    1 small onion, finely chopped
    1 clove garlic, minced
	
Stir tomato sauce, chiles, vinegar, honey, paprika, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, ground chipotle and 
  salt in a 6-quart slow cooker until smooth. Add chicken, onion and garlic; stir to combine.
Put the lid on and cook on low until the chicken can be pulled apart, about 5 hours.
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and shred with a fork. Return the chicken to the sauce, stir well and serve.

Notes: Very good and easy. I used a full 16 oz can of tomato sauce and slightly less chicken than called for;
the result was pretty saucy. The rest of the sauce ingredients go well together and make a convincing bbq 
sauce.


Crockpot French Toast

1/2 loaf of bread

Combine:
6 eggs, 1 c milk, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp light brown sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla

Use cooking spray to grease your crock pot!
Dunk each piece of bread into the egg mixture and place inside the greased crockpot. 
Pour remaining egg mixture over the top of the bread.  Set crockpot to lowest cooking setting. 
"Warm" is not a cooking setting, so set your crock pot to LOW.  Place cover ontop. 
Do not over fill your crockpot. Cook for 6- 8 hours. Mine cooked in 7.
In the morning you will find a fluffly, bread pudding-souffle like breakfast.  
You will see cooked egg on the edges of the bread slices. Carefully remove the lid about 
15 minutes before its done and it will brown and toast.


Broccoli Salad

2 heads fresh broccoli
1 red onion
1/2 pound bacon
3/4 cup raisins
3/4 cup sliced almonds
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar

Place bacon in a deep skillet and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. 
  Cool and crumble.
Cut the broccoli into bite-size pieces and cut the onion into thin bite-size slices. 
  Combine with the bacon, raisins, your favorite nuts and mix well.
To prepare the dressing, mix the mayonnaise, sugar and vinegar together until smooth. 
  Stir into the salad, let chill and serve.

Notes: Simple and good. The dressing is pretty sweet but brings out the natural sweetness
of the broccoli nicely. Be careful in pouring the dressing over the rest of the salad;
it might not require the entire batch. We used sunflower seed kernals instead of sliced
almonds and those were very good in the salad.
  

  
Chicken and Wild Rice Soup

    6 tbsp butter (3/4 stick)
    1/4 small onion, minced (about 2-3 tbsp)
    1/2 cup flour

    2 cups cooked wild rice
    1/2 tsp salt
    2 cups milk
    2 chicken breasts, cubed
    1 medium carrot, finely chopped
    2-3 tbsp slivered almonds
    2 oz mushrooms (optional)

Boil chicken in the chicken stock for 10 minutes. Pour the stock+chicken into a pot with the wild rice, 
carrot, salt, almond, and mushroom. Melt butter in pan and sautee the onions in it. Add flour and mix. 
Pour the milk into the flour-butter mixture a little at a time with constant stirring, until blended 
smooth. Add white sauce to the pot and heat to serving temperature. Serve garnished with parsley.



French Onion Soup Stuffed Mushrooms

    2 Tablespoons Butter
    2 whole Large Onions, Halved And Sliced Thin
    1/4 cup Beef Broth
    7 dashes Worcestershire Sauce
    Splash Of Red Or White Wine
    1/2 cup Grated Gruyere Cheese (can Use Swiss)
    Kosher Salt
    24 whole White Or Crimini Mushrooms, Washed And Stems Removed
    Minced Parsley


In a medium skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add onions and saute for 15 to 20 minutes, 
stirring occasionally, until very soft. Splash in wine, broth, and Worcestershire. 
Cook for another 5 minutes, or until liquid is cooked down. Set aside.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Throw in mushrooms and toss around for 2 minutes, 
just to start the cooking process. Sprinkle mushrooms with salt.

Place mushroom caps face down in a baking dish. Heap cavity with sauteed mushrooms, then sprinkle Gruyere over the top. 
Bake at 10 minutes on 325 degrees. Turn on broiler and broil for a couple of minutes, until the top of the Gruyere 
starts to bubble and slightly turn brown.

Sprinkle minced parsley over the top and serve.



Baked Jalapeno Poppers

12 jalapeno peppers, about 2 1/2-inches long
1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper
2 large eggs
2/3 cup dry unseasoned breadcrumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
sour cream

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly grease a bak­ing sheet and set aside.

Carefully slice peppers in half lengthwise. Scrape out and discard the seeds and membranes.

Combine the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, garlic powder, and chipotle pepper in a bowl. 
Mix until well combined. Spoon the mixture into each pepper half, pressing down to fill them solidly.

Beat the eggs in a bowl until frothy. In a zip-top bag, combine the breadcrumbs and salt. 
Dip the filled pepper halves into the egg, then toss in the bag with the breadcrumbs until evenly coated.

Place the coated peppers on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. 
Serve hot.

Notes: These are extremely good! I was unsure I wanted to add the chipotle to the cheese mix at first but
it turned out to be great. The extra heat was balanced out by the cheddar/cream cheese. Further note - large
jalapenos may require 5-10 more minutes of cooking time.


Bacon Wrapped Dates

Cut American bacon slices into thirds. 
Wrap sliced third around each date, and pin with a tooth pick. 
Bake at 400F for approx 10-15 minutes.

Or stuff dates with goat cheese or blue cheese and bake. Optionally
roll dates in brown sugar before baking.

Notes: Yummy! You can make thick-cut bacon work but I think the thinner cut would be better.

*An alternative way of making this, if you don't have baked potatoes on hand is to peel and cube uncooked potatoes.  
 Then add the chicken in frozen.  This will ensure that the uncooked potatoes and the chicken will cook at the same 
 rate.

 
 
Hungarian Paprika Sauce

2 tablespoons bacon or 2 tablespoons butter or 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or 2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1 large tomato, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 sweet pepper, chopped (red, orange or yellow)
1/2 cup sour cream

Saute the onions in the fat until they are soft.
Add the tomato, paprika, salt and bell pepper.
Continue cooking the sauce for an additional 20 minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream
 
Notes: A really good general-purpose sauce. It has all the elements you'd expect from a Hungarian sauce - 
creamy with a nice paprika flavor. We used it on leftover turkey breast but it would be great with noodles
too.


Fresh Green Beans, Fennel, and Feta Cheese

1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
1 fennel bulb, cut into thin slices
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Fill a saucepan half full with water and bring to a boil. 
Add the green beans and fennel slices; cook until just beginning to become tender, about 4 minutes. 
Pour into a colander to drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process.
Return the empty pan to the stove and set heat to medium. Pour in the olive oil and let it heat for a minute. 
Return the green beans and fennel to the pan. 
Season with basil, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until coated and warm. 
Transfer to a serving dish and toss with feta cheese.

Notes: Very good! A nice different combination of flavors. Good way to use a fennel bulb.


Mediterranean Chicken with Eggplant

3 eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise
into 1/2 inch thick slices
3 tablespoons olive oil
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - diced
1 onion, diced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste

Place eggplant strips in a big pot of lightly salted water and soak for 30 minutes (this will improve the taste; they will leave a brown color in the pot).
Remove eggplant from pot and brush lightly with olive oil. Saute or grill until lightly browned and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Set aside.
Saute diced chicken and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in tomato paste and water, cover skillet, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour chicken/tomato mixture over eggplant. Season with oregano, salt and pepper and cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.


Baingan Bharta (Eggplant Curry)

1 large eggplant
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tomato, diced
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 fresh jalapeno chile pepper, finely
chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 bunch cilantro, finely chopped

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place eggplant on a medium baking sheet. Bake 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until tender. Remove from heat, cool, peel, and chop.
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Mix in cumin seeds and onion. Cook and stir until onion is tender.
Mix ginger garlic paste, curry powder, and tomato into the saucepan, and cook about 1 minute. Stir in yogurt. 
Mix in eggplant and jalapeno pepper, and season with salt. Cover, and cook 10 minutes over high heat. 
Remove cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.


Crock Pot Beef Burgundy

4 slices bacon
2 lbs beef stew meat
2 carrots, cut into chunks
1 onion, sliced
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
12 ounces condensed beef broth
1/2 cup Burgundy wine ( or other dry red wine)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
16 ounces egg noodles, uncooked
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions

Cook bacon until crisp; drain, and crumble.
Place beef, bacon, carrots, and onions in the bottom of the crock pot.
Whisk together flour, marjoram, garlic, and pepper with broth, wine and Worcestershire sauce.
Pour mixture into crockpot.
Cook on high for 1 hour.
Reduce to low and cook for 5-6 hours.
Add mushrooms to crock pot.
Cook on high for 30 minutes or until mushrooms are cooked to your liking.
While mushrooms are cooking, prepare noodles according to package directions.
Serve beef over noodles garnished with parsley, if desired.


Zucchini Bites

1 cups zucchini, grated
1 egg (1 large egg equals 3-4 tbsp when whisked together)
1/4 yellow onion, diced
1/4 cup cheese (cheddar or Parmesan work the best)
1/4 cup bread crumbs - I used Italian style
Salt and Pepper

1. Preheat oven to 400F. Spray a mini-muffin tin with non-stick spray, set aside.
2. Grate the zucchini and then place in a dish towel to squeeze out the excess water- like when using 
   frozen spinach; if you skip this part, the middle of the zucchini tots will be really soggy while 
   the outside gets crispy and no one wants that.
3. In a bowl combine, the egg, onion, cheese, bread crumbs, zucchini, salt and pepper.
4. Using a spoon or a cookie scoop, fill the muffin cups to the top. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until 
   the top is browned and set.
   
Notes: Excellent and easy to make! I added a little fresh basil and one clove of minced garlic. Very good.
I used a scant 1/4 cup of bread crumb; maybe corn meal could be substituted?


Corn Chowder

2 tablespoons butter
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups canned vegetable stock
2 cups heavy cream
2 Idaho potatoes, peeled and diced
6 ears corn
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and 
thyme and cook until the vegetables are good and soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Dust the vegetables with flour 
and stir to coat everything well. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the cream and 
the potatoes, bring to a boil and boil hard for about 7 minutes, until the potatoes break down 
(this will help to thicken the soup and give it a good texture).

Cut the corn kernels off the cob and add to the soup. Season with salt and pepper and simmer until 
the corn is soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the parsley and give it another little drink of 
olive oil. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve.

Notes: Really nice corn flavor. An excellent way to save excess supply in the freezer for a taste of
summer in the winter.


Corn Relish

8 ears corn, husked and cleaned
2 pounds tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and
coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cups chopped green bell peppers
3/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cucumber, chopped
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup white sugar
2 cups apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon mustard seed

1. 	Cut the corn from the cobs. Scrape the cobs with a large spoon to remove remaining juices.
2. 	In a large saucepan, mix the corn kernels and juice, tomatoes, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, cucumber and onion.
3. 	In a medium bowl, mix the sugar, apple cider vinegar, salt, celery seed and mustard seed. Pour into the saucepan over vegetable mixture. 
    Bring to a boil, then simmer 1 hour.
4. 	Transfer the finished relish to sterile jars. Refrigerate until serving.

Not sure about this one - need to try other corn relishes to compare. I was somewhat put off by the
heavy vinegar/sweet pickle flavor and couldn't really taste the corn. Is this what all corn relishes are like?


Earl Grey Tea Cookies 

(Adapted from Real Simple)

Makes about 6 dozen cookies.

    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/2 cup granulated sugar
    1/2 cup confectioners sugar
    2 tablespoons Earl Grey tea leaves, from approximately 6 tea bags

        salt and pepper
        1 egg, beaten
        2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

    Combine the melted butter, garlic salt and 1/4 teaspoons sage; brush over cut sides and cavity of squash. Salt and pepper to taste.
    Bake in a large roasting pan, cut side up, at 400 degrees F for 1 hour, until squash is tender yet still holds its shape.
    Meanwhile make stuffing: Fry pork sausage until light brown. Remove pork to a colander to drain. Drain all but 2 tablespoons drippings from frypan. 
	Add onion, celery and mushroom; saute 4 minutes. Stir in apple and saute 2 more minutes.
    Combine the pork, vegetables, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl.
    Taste and season with sage, salt or pepper if needed (depending on your sausage you may not want to add more seasoning).
    Stir in the egg and parsley.
    Fill the squash halves with stuffing-they should be slightly mounded.
    Return to oven and bake, covered, for 20 more minutes, until the egg is set.
    Garnish as desired with parsley and shredded romano cheese.
	
Notes: Good and different. A nice hearty meal for a cool night.

Cranberry Upside-Down Cake
Serves 8 to 10

You will need a 9- or 10-inch cake pan with at least 2-inch high sides for this recipe. Adapted from Simplyrecipes.com.

4 Tbsp. (1/4 cup or 1/2 stick) unsalted butter
3/ 4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
12 oz. fresh or frozen cranberries
1? 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. ground ginger
1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
Scant pinch ground cloves
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, room temp (plus more for buttering the pan)
3 large eggs
1 Tbsp. orange zest
1/2 cup sour cream (or plain yogurt)
1/4 cup of milk

1. Generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9- or 10-inch diameter cake pan.

2. In a small saucepan, place the 1/4 cup of butter and the 3/4 cups of packed brown sugar. On medium high heat, 
   stir the sugar as the butter melts. Do not stir after the butter has melted.

3. Pour the brown sugar butter mixture into the prepared cake pan. Spread the cranberries on top of the sugar butter mixture.

4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.

5. In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter until light. Add the sugar and beat together the 
   sugar and butter until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in the orange zest.

6. Mix a third of the dry ingredients into the mixture. Beat in half of the sour cream. Mix in another third of the 
   dry ingredients. Mix in the remaining sour cream. Beat in the remaining dry ingredients and then the milk.

7. Pour batter over the cranberries in the cake pan, and smooth the surface. Place in the preheated oven and lower 
   the heat from 350 degrees to 325 degrees. Bake until a tester comes out clean, 55 minutes to an hour. 
   Cool cake in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Run a blunt knife around the inside rim of the cake pan to loosen 
   the cake from the sides of the pan. Then turn the cake out onto a platter.



More Home-made Green Bean Casserole

  We loved making green bean casserole with fresh green beans but I wanted to stop using cans of condensed soup as well.
  
1 pound green beans

Topping:
2 medium onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Nonstick cooking spray

Mushroom Sauce  
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 pound fresh green beans, rinsed, trimmed and halved
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
12 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup half-and-half

Topping:
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.

Combine the onions, flour, panko and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. 
Coat a sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray and evenly spread the onions on the pan. 
Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes. 
Toss the onions 2 to 3 times during cooking. 
Once done, remove from the oven and set aside until ready to use. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F.

Beans:
While the onions are cooking, prepare the beans. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a 
boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately 
plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.
OR
Lightly steam them and skip using a gallon of water plus more for the ice water bath. They still need to be
really crisp because they're going to cook further in the casserole.

Mushroom Sauce, Assembly of Casserole:
Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. 
Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to 
  give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. 
Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. 
Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. 
Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute. 
Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, 
  approximately 6 to 8 minutes.

Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions. 
Place into the oven (400 F) and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.

Notes: I included the entire recipe here. Sometime I may make the topping but so far I've used the canned
french fried onions to good effect. I steamed the green beans instead of blanching and they were fine. Other
things I did differently - I didn't use a cast iron pan; the seasoning on ours wasn't up to snuff. I made the sauce
in a large saute pan on the stove, added all the other ingredients and poured them into a casserole dish. I added
the onions for topping and baked at 450 (I missed the part about reducing temp to 400) for 12-15 minutes. I think the
400 degree temp would probably be better but it was very good!



Kickin' Collard Greens
  -AllRecipes.com
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 slices bacon
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt	
1 teaspoon pepper
3 cups chicken broth
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 pound fresh collard greens, cut into 2-inch pieces

1. 	Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add bacon, and cook until crisp. Remove bacon from pan, crumble and 
    return to the pan. Add onion, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, and cook until just fragrant. 
	Add collard greens, and fry until they start to wilt.
2. 	Pour in chicken broth, and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 
    for 45 minutes, or until greens are tender.

Notes: Really good and nice in that it takes only basic ingredients. The bacon-onion-garlic provides a great background
flavor. I usually just use the pinch of red pepper flakes but there's no reason not to grind your own hot spice mix.



Spicy Beef Kebabs
  - Alton Brown
1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless beef sirloin
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil

Cut the beef into 1 1/2 to 1 3/4-inch cubes and place into a large mixing bowl. Set aside.

In the bowl of a food processor combine the garlic, paprika, turmeric, cumin, salt, pepper and red wine vinegar. 
With the processor running drizzle in the olive oil.

Pour the marinade over the meat and toss to coat. Place in the refrigerator in an airtight container or a sealable 
plastic bag and allow to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.

Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Thread the meat onto the skewers leaving about 1/2-inch in between the 
pieces of meat. Place on the grill and cook, with lid lowered, 2 to 3 minutes per side, 8 to 12 minutes in all 
(8 minutes for rare and 12 for medium). Remove from the heat to aluminum foil, wrap and allow to rest for 2 to 
3 minutes prior to serving.

Notes: Really good marinade! I just hand-whisked the emulsion instead of dirtying the food processor and it turned out
just fine. I also broiled our kebab sirloin, though would have preferred it grilled. Tasty - I'll probably steal the
marinade for other purposes.

other Christmas goodies.


Chocolate Pudding Trifle

Ingredients
Chocolate Cake:

Use your favorite chocolate cake recipe or even a box of your favorite chocolate cake mix. Allow cake to 
cool for 15 minutes before proceeding. Break up the cake into small pieces in a large bowl.

Chocolate Pudding Filling:

2 packages instant chocolate pudding mix
3 cups whole milk

Whipped Cream:

2 cups heavy cream
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Garnish:

About 1 cup chocolate wafer crumbs, or chocolate-sandwich cookies, crushed into crumbs

Prepare the chocolate cake as recommended above.
To prepare the chocolate pudding filling: In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, beat 
the instant pudding and the milk for 3 minutes. Place uncovered in the refrigerator and chill until set, 
about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium-size bowl, whip the heavy cream with the sugar and the vanilla extract until soft 
peaks form, being careful not to overwhip.

To assemble the trifle: Place 1/3 of the cake in the bottom of a large glass bowl. Place over this 1/3 of 
the pudding mixture, spreading evenly with a rubber spatula. Spread 1/3 of the whipped cream over this. 
Sprinkle with 1/3 of the cookie crumbs. Proceed in this fashion until three layers have been assembled, 
ending with a dusting of the cookie crumbs. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight, before cutting 
and serving.

Notes: This is really good! It goes together quite easily. The homemade whipped cream is worth making.



Pork Stir Fry with Green Onion

    1 pound pork loin or boneless pork chops
    2 Tbsp soy sauce
    1 teaspoon sugar
    1 teaspoon corn starch
    4 Tbsp peanut oil or other high smoke point oil (canola, rice bran, or grape seed)
    5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
    8-12 scallions/green onions, sliced diagonally into 1 to 2-inch pieces, green and white parts included
    1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)

1 Cut pork in to bite-sized pieces or into a 1 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/2 julienne.

2 Put the soy sauce, sugar, and corn starch into a large bowl and whisk to combine.  Add the pork strips to 
  the bowl with the marinade and toss to coat completely. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.

3 Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large sauté pan on high heat. When the oil is hot (shimmering but not smoking) 
  add the garlic slices and stir-fry until they begin to turn brown at the edges, about 30 seconds. Add the pork 
  strips and stir-fry until the pork changes color, about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.

4 Add the sliced green onions and continue to stir-fry for another minute, or until the green onions wilt. 
  Turn off the heat and stir in the sesame oil, if using.
  
Notes: Simple but good. Goes together quickly.

  
  
Classic Mornay Sauce

2 1/2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups warmed milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
pinch freshly grated nutmeg (optional)
2 ounces grated cheese, such as Gruyere

In a medium saucepan melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the 
roux is pale yellow and frothy, about 1 minute. Do not allow the roux to brown. Slowly whisk in the milk and continue 
to whisk until the sauce thickens and comes to a boil, about 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to a simmer and season 
with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. Allow to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. This is now called a bechamel sauce, and may 
be used as is to top any number of dishes.

Stir in the cheese and whisk until melted. If the sauce seems too thick, thin with a little milk.

The sauce is now called a Mornay Sauce.


Simple Guacamole

2 avocados
1/4 small onion, finely chopped (or maybe cut back to 2-3 Tablespoons)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small tomato, seeded and chopped
1 lime, juiced (or 2 if you like limey guac)
salt and pepper to taste
optional: chopped cilantro

Mash avocadoes, mix in lime juice. Add in rest of ingredients; season.

Notes: I like a bit of onion but too much covers the flavor of the avocado.


Green Chile-Chicken Enchiladas

Salsa Verde
12 tomatillos, husked and rinsed
2 jalapeno peppers, stemmed
1 onion, quartered
Splash white vinegar
Water
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped
2 limes, juiced
Salt

Enchilada Filling
3 poblano peppers
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, sliced
3 garlic cloves, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups canned chicken stock
1 deli roasted chicken, about 3 pounds, boned, meat shredded
Leaves from 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 large corn tortillas
1/2 pound Monterey jack cheese, shredded

Make the salsa: Put the tomatillos, jalapenos, and onion in a saucepan with the vinegar and water 
to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and poach until the tomatillos are soft, about 10 minutes. 
Drain. Put the vegetables in a blender, add the cumin, and puree. Add the cilantro, lime juice, and
salt, and pulse to combine. Set aside.

Meanwhile, place the poblano peppers directly over the flame on a gas stove and cook, turning with 
tongs, until the skin is charred and blackened. (Or, if you have an electric stove, put the chiles 
on a baking sheet and broil, turning with tongs, until the skin is blackened.) Skin the peppers; 
then seed, core, and dice them.

Heat a 2-count of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until 
softened and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Stir in the cumin and 
cook 1 minute. Then sprinkle on the flour and cook, stirring, 1 more minute. Gradually pour in the 
stock, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer, stirring to make sure the flour doesn't stick to 
the bottom of the pan; the liquid will thicken. Fold in the chicken, diced peppers, and cilantro, 
and season well with salt and pepper.

To assemble the dish: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Get your self a large baking dish. Dip 
a tortilla into the tomatilla salsa and put it on a cutting board. Put a big scoop of the chicken 
mixture in the center, sprinkle with a little of the cheese, and roll the tortilla like a cigar 
to enclose the filling. Use a spatula to place it seam side down in the baking dish. Continue to 
fill all of the tortillas and put them in the baking dish. Pour the remaining tomatilla salsa 
over the top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake uncovered for about 30 minutes until 
bubbly and cracked on top. Serve hot with the guacamole and sour cream

Notes: This is really good and well worth the effort to make occasionally. I took a few shortcuts when
I made it. Firstly, I used Anaheim peppers instead of poblanos. No problemo. Then instead of broiling
the peppers I sauted them with the onion. I know we missed a little of the yummy char/roasty flavor but
needed the extra time to make guacamole. My enchilada filling didn't thicken like I wanted; I probably 
should have let it simmer for a bit longer but it was still really good!

Chewy Butterfinger Cookies

    1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
    3/4 teaspoon baking soda
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    3/4 cup granulated sugar
    1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter, softened
    1 large egg*
    8 fun sized butterfinger candy bars, chopped

Preheat oven to 375F degrees.

Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in small bowl and set aside. With an electric mixer, beat sugar 
and butter until creamy. Beat in egg until just combined.
Gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in butterfinger pieces by hand. The dough will be very thick. 
Drop by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Allow to cool and enjoy!
Sally's Tip: *If dough seems too dry, mix in 1 extra egg.



FRANK'S REDHOT BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP

1 pkg. (8 oz.) PHILADELPHIA cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup FRANK'S® REDHOT® Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce or FRANK'S® REDHOT® Buffalo Wings Sauce
1/2 cup blue cheese or ranch dressing
2 cups shredded cooked chicken.
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese or your favorite shredded cheese 

PREHEAT oven to 350°F.
COMBINE all ingredients in a 1-quart baking dish.
BAKE 20 min. or until mixture is heated through; stir. Serve with crackers or vegetables.

Slow Cooker Method: Combine ingredients as directed above. Place mixture into small slow cooker. 
Cover pot. Heat on HIGH setting for 1 1/2 hours until hot and bubbly or on LOW setting for 2 1/2 
to 3 hours. Stir.

Notes: Pretty good! For me, not the same as Buffalo wings but it's certainly a recipe inspired by
Buffalo wings. If you use fresh chicken make sure to dice it finely - large pieces of chicken are
awkward for tortilla chips. We used blue cheese all the way and did not regret it. I also didn't
have enough basic wing sauce so used a few glugs of a habanero-based sauce to round out what we 
needed. That certainly added a punch! In the crockpot be sure to stir frequently as the cheese tends
to want to stick to the bottom.


Bourbon-Glazed Chicken Drumettes

2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter
1 cup chopped onion
3 garlic cloves, peeled, thinly sliced
1 cup bourbon, divided
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Crystal)
1/4 cup tomato paste
3 tablespoons (packed) golden brown sugar
30 chicken drumettes (about 4 pounds)

Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. 
Add onion and garlic; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. 
Add 3/4 cup bourbon; boil until most of liquid is absorbed, 6 to 8 minutes. 
Whisk in 1/4 cup bourbon, ketchup, hot pepper sauce, tomato paste, and brown sugar. Bring to boil. 
Reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. 
Season marinade with salt and pepper. Remove marinade from heat; cool to room temperature.
Place chicken drumettes in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Pour marinade over and turn drumettes to coat. 
Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. Place cooling rack atop prepared baking sheet. 
Arrange drumettes on rack, spacing slightly apart. Spread any remaining marinade from dish over drumettes. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake drumettes (still on cooling rack) until cooked through and brown in spots, about 45 minutes. 

Notes: Ok, they are tasty and good to eat. However, I feel they fall far short because of the overriding 
ketchupy flavor. Very light on bourbon flavor too. The recipe is probably salvagable but you'd need to reduce 
the ketchup and tomato paste by half just as a start. I think you're probably better off heading to the internet
and finding a different bourbon glaze recipe!


Smoked Salmon BLTs

4 slices thick cut bacon
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill leaves
8 (1/2-inch thick) slices multigrain bread
6 ounces smoked salmon
1 cup arugula, divided
2 large or 3 medium tomatoes, sliced

In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy.
Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.

In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice, and fresh dill. 
Spread the lemon mayonnaise over 1 side of each slice of bread. 
Arrange the smoked salmon on 4 slices of the bread. Break the bacon in half and put on top of the smoked salmon. 
Top the bacon with 1/2 cup of arugula and arrange 2 to 3 tomato slices on top of the arugula. 
Cover with remaining slices of bread, lemon mayonnaise side down.


Shrimp Scampi 

3 T butter
3 T olive oil
3-5 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 T chopped fresh parsley
juice of 1/2 lemon

Melt butter and olive oil together over low-med heat, then add garlic and sprinkle with some salt. 
Let cook for about three minutes. Do not burn the garlic. 
Add shrimp, cook for about two minutes (depending on size), then turn. 
Cook until the other side is pink and opaque. Remove from heat. 
Add parsley and lemon juice.


Cookie Dough Bark

    4 ounces or 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
    2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
    2 tbsp milk
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/2 tsp salt
    2/3 cup mini chocolate chips
    1 lb chocolate candy coating
    2 oz white chocolate candy coating, optional

1. In the bowl of a large stand mixer, combine the softened butter and the brown sugar. 
   Beat them together on medium speed using a paddle attachment until they're light and fluffy, 
   about 2-3 minutes.
2. With the mixer running on low, add the milk and vanilla and beat until they're incorporated.
3. Stop the mixer and add the flour and salt, and mix everything on low until the flour streaks have 
   almost disappeared. Add the miniature chocolate chips, and stir them in by hand, scraping down the 
   bottom and sides of the bowl to make sure all of the flour is incorporated. Set aside for a moment.
4. Line a baking sheet with foil. Melt the chocolate candy coating in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring 
   after every 30 seconds to prevent overheating.
5. Pour approximately half of the chocolate onto the baking sheet, and spread it into a thin, even layer, 
   less than 1/4-inch thick. It doesn't need to cover the entire pan. Place the tray in the refrigerator 
   to quickly cool down and set the chocolate.
6. Once set, gently spread the cookie dough over the chocolate so that it covers the entire surface of 
   chocolate.
7. If the remaining coating has started to set, warm it up so that it's fluid again. Pour it over the 
   cookie dough, and spread it into an even layer across the top. If desired, melt the white chocolate 
   candy coating and drizzle it all over the top while the coating is still wet. Refrigerate the tray 
   until the chocolate is completely set.
8. Cut the bark into small pieces, or break it into small irregular pieces by hand. Store Cookie Dough 
   Bark in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. 



Raleys Irish Corned Beef Stew

1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket (with spice packet), excess fat trimmed and meat cut into 1-inch cubes
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 cups peeled and cubed parsnips
2 cups peeled and cubed carrots
1 extra large onion, cut into chunks
1 1/2 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth
1 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar

Place flour into a large bowl; toss corned beef cubes in flour to coat.
Heat olive oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and brown corned beef cubes on all sides, about 10 minutes.
Sprinkle the spice packet from the corned beef over the meat; mix in potatoes, parsnips, carrots, onion, water, stout beer, 
  beef broth, and any unused flour; stir to combine. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer until corned beef is very tender and the stew has thickened, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Mix cabbage into the stew and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in vinegar.

	
	
Irish Chicken and Dumplings

2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream
of chicken soup
3 cups water
1 cup chopped celery
2 onions, quartered
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
5 carrots, sliced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen green peas
4 potatoes, quartered
3 cups baking mix
1 1/3 cups milk
	
1. 	In large, heavy pot, combine soup, water, chicken, celery, onion, salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper. Cover and cook over low heat about 1 1/2 hours.
2. 	Add potatoes and carrots; cover and cook another 30 minutes.
3. 	Remove chicken from pot, shred it, and return to pot. Add peas and cook only 5 minutes longer.
4. 	Add dumplings. To make dumplings: Mix baking mix and milk until a soft dough forms. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto BOILING stew. 
    Simmer covered for 10 minutes, then uncover and simmer an additional 10 minutes.

Notes: Possibly a bit bland according to some reviews. I think maybe you could use boneless skinless thighs or skinned whole 
       pieces of chicken for better flavor. I would also like to make homemade condensed cream of chicken soup instead of using
	   the super-processed canned stuff. I bet some leeks and turnips would be good in this. I also bet if you sauted the aromatics
	   before adding the soup and broth that would improve the flavor too!

	   
Homemade Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup

    1 1/2 cups chicken broth
    1 1/2 cups milk or milk alternative, divided
    1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
    1/4 teaspoon onion powder
    1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
    1/8 teaspoon black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
    Dash paprika
    5 tablespoons corn starch
    Shredded chicken as desired

In a medium saucepan, bring to boil chicken broth, 1/2 cup milk, poultry seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, 
  salt and pepper, parsley, and paprika stirring occasionally.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup milk and cornstarch until smooth and watery. 
Slowly add the cornstarch mix to the saucepan stirring constantly. 
Return mixture to a boil and continue stirring until the soup thickens.
Remove from stove and cool. Add desired amount of shredded chicken. 
  (I use less than half of a chicken breast. Or, you can eliminate the chicken. The base is yummy even without the chicken.) 
Use as an ingredient in your signature recipes.


Dublin Coddle - Irish Sausage, Bacon, Onion and Potato Hotpot

2 kg potatoes
2 large onions, peeled and sliced thickly
450 g good quality pork sausages
450 g bacon, piece thick cut
500 ml water
1 ham stock cube or 1 beef or 1 chicken stock cube, if ham stock isn't available
3 -4 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
salt ( to season)
coarse-ground pepper ( to season)

Peel the potatoes. Cut large ones into three or four pieces: leave smaller ones whole. 
Finely chop the parsley. Boil the water and in it dissolve the bouillon cube.
Grill or broil the sausages and bacon long enough to colour them. Be careful not to dry them out! Drain briefly on paper towels. 
When drained, chop the bacon into one-inch pieces. If you like, chop the sausages into large pieces as well. 
  (Some people prefer to leave them whole.).
Preheat the oven to 300F / 150°C 
In a large flameproof heavy pot with a tight lid, start layering the ingredients: onions, bacon, sausages or sausage pieces, potatoes. 
Season each layer liberally with fresh-ground pepper and the chopped fresh parsley. Continue until the ingredients are used up. 
Pour the bouillon mixture over the top. On the stove, bring the liquid to a boil. Immediately turn the heat down and cover the pot. 
  (You may like to additionally put a layer of foil underneath the pot lid to help seal it.).
Put the covered pot in the oven and cook for at least three hours. (Four or five hours won't hurt it.) 
At the two-hour point, check the pot and add more water if necessary. There should be about an inch of liquid at the bottom of the pot at all times.
To Serve. Guinness, bottled or draft, goes extremely well with this dish (indeed, adding a little to the pot 
  toward the end of the process wouldn't hurt anything). Another good accompaniment is fresh soda bread, used to mop up the gravy!
	
	
	
Classic English Toad-in-the-Hole


    1 1/2 cup of all purpose flour
    1 scant teaspoon Kosher salt
    Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
    3 eggs, beaten
    1 1/2 cup milk
    2 Tbsp melted butter
    1 Tbsp vegetable oil
    1 lb of bangers (an English sausage made with pork and breadcrumbs), or good quality pork or beef sausage links (in casings)

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour with the salt and a pinch of pepper. Make a well in the center of the flour. 
Pour in the eggs, milk, and melted butter into the well and whisk into the flour until smooth. Cover and let stand 30 minutes.
Coat the bottom and sides of an 8x12 or 9x9 casserole dish with vegetable oil. Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven. 
Put the empty dish on the rack. Preheat the oven with the dish in it to 425°F.
While the oven is coming to temperature, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a skillet on medium high. 
Add the sausages and brown them on at least a couple sides.
When the sausages have browned, and the dish in the oven hot, pull the oven rack out a bit, put the sausages in the casserole 
dish and pour the batter over the sausages. 
Cook for about 20-30 minutes or until the batter is risen and golden. 


Baked Falafel

    3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil
    1 cup dried chickpeas, rinsed, picked over and soaked for at least one hour and up to overnight
    1/3 cup chopped red onion (about 1/4th of a medium red onion, chopped)
    1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves
    1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
    3 garlic cloves, minced
    1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1 teaspoon ground sea salt or kosher salt
    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
	
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. 
In a food processor, combine the soaked and drained chickpeas, red onion, parsley, cilantro, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 
garlic, cumin, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.
Using your hands, scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Shape the falafel into small patties, 
  about 2 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. 
Place each falafel on oiled skillet or pan.
Bake for 13 minutes, then remove the falafel from the oven and carefully flip each one. 
Return the pans to the oven for another 13 to 15 minutes, until the falafels are lightly browned on both sides.

Notes: These are awesome! Very flavorful. Don't skimp on the fresh herbs. The patties brown nicely in the oven. 
Starting with dried chick peas is what gives the patties their body, which is important for the oven frying process. 
I made a double batch using a pound of dried chick peas, which was slightly more than 2 cups. I doubled everything 
else and tossed in a bit more of the herbs to even it out. The patties reheat very nicely in the microwave.



Crockpot General Tso's Chicken

2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into 1" pieces) 
1 cup cornstarch, divided 
1 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon pepper 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
1/2 cup sugar 
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce 
1/2 cup unsweetened pineapple juice 
1/3 cup vinegar (white distilled or apple cider) 
4 cloves garlic, minced 
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
1/4 teaspoon dried ginger 
Green onions, chopped, to top Rice and broccoli, to serve

Combine 3/4 cups cornstarch, the salt, and the pepper in a shallow dish. 
Dip the chicken pieces in the cornstarch mixture to coat, shake off excess, and set aside. 
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
Brown the chicken pieces. It should take less than 2 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside. 
In the slow cooker, combine the sugar, soy sauce, pineapple juice, vinegar, garlic, ginger, and cayenne. 
Stir to mix well. Add the chicken to the crock pot and cook on low for 4 hours. 
Check 20 minutes before serving and make sure your sauce is thick enough. If not, take the remaining 1/4 
  cup of cornstarch and mix it with ¼ cup cold water until a slurry forms. Then, gently mix it into the 
  chicken and sauce, being careful not to scrape the cornstarch coating off of the chicken. 
Cook for another 20 minutes, and then serve over broccoli and rice. Top with chopped green onion.



Kung Pao Shrimp

Shrimp:
1 tablespoon Shaoxing (Chinese rice wine), dry sherry, or sake
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp

Sauce:
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar or balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
3/4 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon dark sesame oil

Remaining ingredients:

   Stir-fry 30 seconds or until sauce thickens. 
   Sprinkle with chopped peanuts. Serve over rice.

Notes: Very nice! I made kung pao scallops, which were very good. I added a sliced
onion with the other veggies and that worked well with everything too. Goes together
easily; a great stir fry recipe.


CUMIN VINAIGRETTE
2 T. red-wine vinegar
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. Dijon mustard
1 tsp. honey (I used more like 1 1/2 tsp. honey)
salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil (I used 1/4 c. EVO and 1/4 c. regular olive oil

Whisk everything together except for the olive oil. 
Then, whisking constantly, drizzle in the olive oil until the dressing thickens slightly. 
Set aside for a short time for flavors to meld.



Turkey Sriracha Meatballs

MEATBALLS
    19 oz. package ground turkey
    1 large egg
    1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
    2 inches fresh ginger
    1/2 tsp soy sauce
    1 bunch green onions (divided)
    Freshly cracked black pepper

SRIRACHA GLAZE
    2 Tbsp soy sauce
    1 Tbsp rice vinegar
    1/4 cup brown sugar
    2 Tbsp sriracha hot sauce
    1/2 cup water (divided)
    2 Tbsp cornstarch

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Add the ground turkey, egg, bread crumbs, soy sauce, 
  and some freshly ground pepper to a large bowl. Peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler 
  or by scraping the skin off with the side of a spoon. Use a small holed cheese grater 
  to grate about two inches of the ginger straight into the bowl. Thinly slice 2-3 of the 
  green onions and add to the bowl (save the rest for later).
Mix the ingredients in the bowl thoroughly. Shape the meat mixture into meatballs about the 
  size of pingpong balls. You should get 25-30 meatballs, depending on the size. Arrange the 
  meatballs on a baking sheet covered in foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
While the meatballs are baking, make the sriracha glaze. In a small pot combine the soy sauce, 
  rice vinegar, brown sugar, sriracha and ¼ cup of the water. Heat and stir the mixture over 
  medium heat until the brown sugar is dissolved. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 
  1/4 cup of water with the cornstarch. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pot with the glaze. 
  Stir to combine. Allow the mixture to come up to a simmer, at which point the glaze will 
  thicken and become glossy.
After the meatballs are finished baking, transfer them to a large bowl and pour the glaze over 
  top. Carefully toss the meatballs to coat in the glaze. Serve hot topped with the remaining 
  sliced green onions.

  
Americas Test Kitchen Buffalo Sauce

1/2 cup Franks Red Hot 
4 Tablespoons butter 
2 Tablespoons Crystal (or any similar hot sauce) 
2 Teaspoons Apple Cider Vinegar 
1 Tablespoon Brown Sugar

Combine, heat through until brown sugar dissolves, tosw with wings.
Enough for roughly 12 wings or so depending on the size.

Notes: Good - enough butter to cling to your chicken pieces but not so much as to give it a 
greasy mouthfeel. I used some Bufalo hot sauce instead of Crystal (didn't have any Crystal) and
it was OK but I'll be using something else next time (Sriracha, Tapatio, etc.).



Restaurant Style Salsa

    1 can (28 Ounce) Whole Tomatoes With Juice
    2 cans (10 Ounce) Rotel (diced Tomatoes And Green Chilies)
    1/4 cup Chopped Onion
    1 clove Garlic, Minced
    1 whole Jalapeno, Quartered And Sliced Thin
    1/4 teaspoon Sugar
    1/4 teaspoon Salt
    1/4 teaspoon Ground Cumin
    1/2 cup Cilantro (more To Taste!)
    1/2 whole Lime Juice

Note: this is a very large batch. Recommend using a 12-cup food processor, or you can process the 
ingredients in batches and then mix everything together in a large mixing bowl.

Combine whole tomatoes, Rotel, onion, jalapeno, garlic, sugar, salt, cumin, lime juice, and cilantro 
in a blender or food processor. Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you'd like---I do 
about 10 to 15 pulses. Test seasonings with a tortilla chip and adjust as needed.

Refrigerate salsa for at least an hour. Serve with tortilla chips or cheese nachos.

1/4 tsp kosher salt 
1/2 tsp baking soda 
12 oz pack chocolate morsels

No. 8 Iron Skillet 
Parchment Paper

Cream dark brown sugar, sugar, and softened butter together.
Mix in egg and vanilla.
Mix in baking soda, salt, and flour.
Mix in chocolate morsels.
Cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan. Spread cookie dough evenly in pan.

Pizza Quinoa Casserole

    1 C uncooked quinoa cooked in 2 C water or about 3½ C cooked quinoa
    1 6oz can tomato paste
    3-4 large cloves garlic, finely minced, grated or pressed
    1/2 small onion, finely chopped
    2 tbsp water
    2 tbsp good quality extra virgin olive oil
    1 tsp oregano
    1/2 tsp fennel seed
    1 tsp marjoram
    1 tsp basil
    1 tbsp dried parsley
    1/4 tsp sugar
    1/2 tsp salt
    dash black pepper
    1/2 C mozzarella cheese, to top(optional)

Rinse quinoa well and combine with water in a small pot over high heat. 
Bring to a boil, cover and turn down to low and simmer for 15 minutes until all the liquid is absorbed, 
  the quinoa is tender and completely cooked. 
Remove from the heat and leave covered in the pot for 5 minutes while assembling other ingredients.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 4  1 cup ramekins, 2  2 cup dishes or a larger casserole dish.
In a small bowl, combine the tomato paste with the garlic and onion, water and olive oil. Mix well. 
Add all the seasonings including the nutritional yeast if using. Mix well again before adding the quinoa. 
Once the mixture is completely mixed, taste for seasonings and add more salt as needed. 
Divide evenly among the dishes for baking, sprinkle with cheese if desired and place in the oven. 
Bake 30-35 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly or until the quinoa on top is golden and crispy. 
If desired, sprinkle with fresh basil or parsley and serve.

Notes: This is a very good side dish. I'm tempted to add some small chunks of mozarella to the mix rather
than just sprinkle it on the top.


Pasteli (Greek sesame stick candy)

1 cup honey
1 cup sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon salt

In a large skillet over low heat, lightly toast the sesame seeds until fragrant (about 2 - 3 minutes).
Heat the honey and salt in a saucepan over low heat. When it has thickened (after about 5 minutes), stir 
  in the sesame seeds and bring the the mixture to boil.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Pour the hot mixture onto the parchment 
  and spread it out to a 1/4 inch thickness. Be careful, as it will be very hot.
Leave the pasteli out on the baking parchment until it comes to room temperature. Once cool, use a sharp knife 
  to cut it into bite size pieces.
Store in an airtight container, with parchment paper in between each layer of candy. Keep in a cool, dry place.
Note: Adding some sugar (up to about 1/4 cup) during the cooking process will create a harder, crisper candy. 
  Without the added sugar, the candy stays on the chewier side. This basic pasteli recipe is simple and delicious 
  on its own, but you can add an extra layor of flavor by adding cinnamon, lemon or orange zest, or even ginger.
User note (from website): A way to help keep the pieces from being too sticky on the outside is to put a layer of 
  toasted sesame seed on the parchment paper then pouring the mixture on top it; then sprinkling another layer of 
  seeds on top. Basically coating the pasteli in a layer of unsugared sesame seeds.
  

  
Cheese Sauce for Cheese Fries and Nachos (Serious Eats)

8 ounces extra sharp cheddar cheese (or a mix of cheddar and pepper Jacksee note), grated on large holes of a box grater
1 tablespoon corn starch
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
2 teaspoons Franks Red Hot or other hot sauce


Add cheese and cornstarch to large bowl. Toss to combine. Transfer to medium saucepan. Add 1 cup evaporated milk and 
hot sauce. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with whisk until melted, bubbly, and thickened (about 5 minutes). 
Mixture will look thin and grainy at first but will thicken and come together after heating. Thin to desired 
consistency with additional evaporated milk. Serve immediately with fries, tortilla chips, burgers, or hot dogs.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/seven-layer-taco-dip/



3 Bean Salad
    1/2 lb. frozen cut green beans
    1/2 lb. frozen purple hull or field peas
    1 (15 oz. can) kidney beans
    1/2 small Vidalia onion
    1/4 bunch fresh parsley
    3 Tbsp olive oil
    1 1/2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
    1/4 tsp garlic powder
    3/4 tsp salt
    freshly cracked pepper

Bring a 2 quart sauce pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the frozen peas. 
Allow the pot to return to a boil then reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the peas to 
simmer for 45 minutes. Either allow the frozen green beans to thaw during this time, or for 
a softer green bean, add the green beans to the boiling water with the peas for the last 3 
minutes of cooking. Drain the peas in a colander and allow them to cool slightly.
Meanwhile, finely dice the onion and roughly chop the parsley. Add both to a large bowl. 
Briefly rinse the kidney beans under cool water, allow the excess water to drain away, 
and then add them to the bowl with the onion and parsley.
To make the dressing, stir together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic powder, salt, 
and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper in a small bowl.
Once the peas have been boiled and cooled, add the peas and green beans to the bowl with 
the rest of the ingredients. Pour the dressing over top, and stir until everything is well 
combined. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

    to taste salt & pepper

Pour the can of beans into a colander and rinse with cool water. Allow the excess water to drain off. 
Drain the can of tuna. Combine the drained beans and tuna in a bowl. Thinly slice the green onions 
and add to the bowl as well.
Add the olive oil and lemon juice to the bowl, along with a light sprinkle of salt and freshly ground 
black pepper. Stir to combine.
Taste the mixture and add salt, pepper, or lemon juice to your liking.


Cream of Brie Soup

1/4 cup butter
1 small onion, minced
3 stalks celery, chopped

1/2 pound Brie cheese with the rind, cubed
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon green bell pepper, cut into very fine matchsticks
1 tablespoon red bell pepper, cut into very fine matchsticks

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook the onions and celery until the onions are translucent, 
about 5 minutes. 
Stir in the flour, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the chicken stock. 
Simmer until the celery is tender, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Stir in the Brie cheese, and allow to melt for about 5 minutes.
Smooth with immersion blender.
Heat the soup to almost simmering over medium-low heat. Pour in the cream. 
To serve, garnish with red and green pepper strips.

Stroganoff Burger

(uses egg noodle cakes as buns)
  
http://www.thefoodinmybeard.com/recipe/stroganoff-burger/

    1 Pound Ground Beef
    8 Ounces Egg Noodles (half a package)
    2 Eggs
    1 Large Onion
    4 Ounces Mushrooms
    1/4 Cup Cream
    1/2 Cup Sour Cream
	
Cook the egg noodles in boiling water until tender. Strain and allow to cool for 3 minutes. 
Whisk in the eggs. Pour into burger bun sized containers that are well greased. Makes 6 buns. 
(for 3 burgers) Weight down so that it is more tight and firm and easy to hold in the end. 
Allow to sit for an hour in the fridge.
    
Slice the onion and cook in buter until browned all around. 20 minutes. Add the mushrooms and 
cook 5 minutes. Add the cream and stir to coat. Remove from heat. Add the sour cream and stir to 
combine.

Form the burger patties to be the same size as the buns but slightly wider. Grill or cook the 
burgers to medium. Meanwhile also cook the pasta buns to brown on both sides and firm up.

Build your burgers using the buns and the burger and top with the mushroom cream sauce.



Cheeseburger Rice

1 pound ground beef
1 med onion, chopped
2 cups water
2/3 cup catsup
2 T prepared mustard
1/2 tsp salt
dash of pepper
2 cups minute rice
4 oz sliced cheese

Brown meat with onion, drain.
Stir in water, catsup, mustard, salt + pepper.
Stir in rice, cover and let stand 5 minutes.
Fluff with fork, add cheese, let stand until melted.

Notes: I used to make this as a bachelor. It's easy like Hamburger Helper but
without having to buy the box. Most of this stuff you generally have around anyway
plus you avoid some of the unnecessary preservatives and junk in the commercial Helper.

More notes: I made it with regular cooked rice. I skipped the water and just eyeballed the
ketchup and mustard. It turned out pretty well. Nathaniel didn't like the onions in it so
next time I'll make it without them. One nice touch was that we had it with sliced summer 
tomatoes. Next time I may top individual servings with some shredded lettuce, sliced
onion and diced tomato for more cheeseburger flavor.


Crockpot Kung Pao Chicken

INGREDIENTS
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1" cubes
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons oil
1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth
1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar or Chinese black vinegar
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
6-10 dried red chili peppers, split and seeds removed (adjust according to desired heat level)
1 orange bell pepper, sliced
1/2 medium white onion, sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced or grated
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Peanuts or cashews, to top
Green onion, to garnish
Rice, to serve

DIRECTIONS
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat (or, if you have a multicooker you can just do it right in the 
crock pot, which is awesome). Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper and saute until browned on all 
sides, about 4 minutes. 
Add the chicken to the crock pot.
Add in the chicken broth, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and hoisin sauce. Give the pot a light stir. 
Then, add in the bell pepper, onion, garlic, and ginger, and stir once more.
Cover and cook on low heat for 4 hours.
About 30 minutes before you've finished cooking (at the 3 hour and 30 minute mark), combine equal parts water
and cornstarch (about 2 tablespoons of each) in a small bowl, whisking together until smooth. Add the slurry 
to the crock pot and mix well. Continue to cook for another 30 minutes, or until sauce has thickened.
While you wait for the sauce to thicken, slice your green onions in half, longways. Keep slicing until you 
have thin strips. Place the green onions in a bowl of ice water and let sit. This will make them curl up. 
Serve the Crock Pot Kung Pao Chicken over rice with peanuts or cashews on top and the curled green onion to 
garnish.

    of doneness, about 6 minutes for medium.
	
Notes: Very yummy. Grating onion might be too much trouble; finely mincing it seems to be ok too.

Calabacitas Soup

    Yellow Squash - 2 medium, chopped
    Zucchini - 2 medium, chopped
    Onion - 1 small, diced
    Garlic - 2-3 cloves, diced
    Tomatoes - 1 can of diced. It is definitely better with fresh tomatoes, but I had this in the pantry.
    Bell pepper - 1 chopped
    Corn - 2 cups frozen, not pictured
    Carrot - 1 chopped thin, or diced
    Olives - sliced, around 7-8 oz.
    Black beans - 1 can drained and rinsed, 15 oz
    Sausage - I used 1/2 of a Polish Kielbasa.
    Chipotle peppers - in adobo sauce. Vary amount depending on how spicy you like it.
    Dried oregano - 1/2 teaspoon
    Cumin - 1/2 teaspoon
    Chicken broth - I recommend the low sodium kind, 32 oz.
    Cheese sauce - 2 cans of Cambells Chedder Cheese, 10.25 oz
	
    Cilantro
    Avacado
    Cotija cheese
    Lime
	
Chop the vegetables into pleasing thicknesses. The squash and zucchini are the main players so go with a med/slightly
larger dice on those. Do not leave carrot too thick. Prep the chipotles but be careful of the amount of heat being
added to the soup!
Add everything to your crock pot. Hold the cilantro, avocado, cojita cheese, and the lime. That is for the finished soup. 
Give the pot a good stir, set it on low, and go find something to do for the next 6 hours. Total prep time for me was around 
20 minutes.
When serving, I like to use a slotted spoon to dish out the vegetable mixture, then use a ladle to add the broth. 
Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro, cojita cheese, and a couple of avacado slices. A squeeze of lime juice freshens the dish up.

Notes: Very good - lots of options for customizing. Next time I think I'm going to cut back to one of the cheddar cheese
soups. I'm not a big fan of that style of cheese and though it helps thicken the soup I'd prefer going another route and stirring
real cheese into individual servings. I used one chipotle and it was pleasantly spicy to my tastes; close to Kate's max.



Potatoes Au Gratin

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-au-gratin-potatoes/

4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
1 onion, sliced into rings
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with the onion slices, and add the remaining potatoes. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. 
Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. 
Pour cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.

Notes: Really good. I ended up using half and half instead of milk and it made for an extremely thick and creamy bechemel.
I also sliced up a couple of jalapenos and added them to the onion layers. It took nearly 2 hours to finish but it was very
good.

Eastern North Carolina BBQ Sauce
	
1 cup white vinegar
1 cup cider vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco), or to taste
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Combine in a jar or bottle with a tight-fitting lid. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 days before using so that 
the flavors will blend. Shake occasionally, and store for up to 2 months in the refrigerator.

Notes: Going to start with 1 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp pepper flakes. Will add 1/2 tsp of each (or more) if
needed.	Yes ~1 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp red pepper flakes makes it plenty potent. Only use that last tsp of
cayenne if you want your sauce to be hot!

Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 hours, or until thickened.
Stir the cream style corn into the stew mixture. Continue cooking 1 hour, or to desired consistency. 
Remove the green pepper; chop and return to the stew or discard. (Notes: Maybe just chop it up to begin with?)
	
Notes: Pretty good. I made a few modifications, as always. I used 2 chicken leg quarters for chicken meat, as that
was what we had that needed to be used. I used 1 pound each of ground beef and ground pork and about 2/3 of the ketchup
and bbq sauce called for - also 2 cans of creamed corn. The corn kind of disappeared into the stew so I added a can
of corn kernals, which was good. I also threw in some old frozen green beans that needed to be used. 
	
	
Creamy Coleslaw
	
6 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup shredded carrot
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 cup sugar (start with half, add more to taste up to full amount)
Salt and pepper

In a large bowl, combine cabbage and carrots. In a smaller bowl, make dressing by combining mayonnaise, vinegar, 
celery seed, sugar, salt and pepper. Toss dressing into cabbage mixture and let chill. Serve in a family style bowl.

Notes: Balance of flavor is good. You can halve the dressing recipe; 1/2 cup mayo, 2T vinegar, 2T (or less) sugar, 
1 tsp celery seed. When I made this I had 8 cups cabbage and still had too much dressing. It's simple and goes together
quickly.


Spicy Black Bean Soup

1 spray(s) cooking spray   
1 medium uncooked onion(s), finely chopped   
4 clove(s) (medium) garlic clove(s), minced   
45 oz canned black beans, undrained, divided (three 15 oz cans)   
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste   
1 tsp ground cumin   
14 1/2 oz fat free chicken broth, or vegetable broth   
10 oz canned tomatoes with green chilis   
11 oz canned yellow corn, drained    

Coat bottom of a large stockpot with cooking spray. Add onion and garlic and cook, 
stirring frequently, until onions are soft but not brown, about 5 minutes.

Place one can of beans in blender; add sautéed onion mixture, red pepper flakes and cumin. 
Cover and blend on high until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pour mixture back into stockpot.

Place second can of beans and broth in blender and puree until smooth; add to stockpot.

Stir third can of beans (do not puree first), tomatoes and green chilies, and corn into 
stockpot. Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. 

Yields about 1 1/2 cups of soup per serving. 

Notes: This is the best black bean soup recipe! It's simple but very satisfying. Since we have
a stick blender we do all of it in one pot. Saute the veggies; add spices, broth and 2 cans of 
beans then stick blend. Lastly add the other ingredients and simmer. Great as a side dish on
Mexican night but is also perfectly suited as a main dish with a quesadilla or corn bread as
the accompaniment. Top with sour cream, green onion, diced jalapeno, diced onion, shredded 
cheddar, etc. Kate originally found this recipe and we make it a couple of times a year.


Curried chicken, West Indian (Guyanese) Style

Chicken legs and thighs - enough to fill half a large stock pot or dutch oven - leg bones are a must have, thigh bones optional
Curry powder - ~ 2.5 tbsp (can be a mix of curry, garam masala, tumeric)
Chicken stock or water - 2 cups
Onion - 1 large diced
Tomatoes - 2 ripe ones, or a can of whole tomatoes will do
Carrots - 3 large diced
Potatoes - 3-4 cut in quarters
Chickpeas - 1 cup
Lentils (optional) - 1/2 cup
Green peas - handful
Shaved Coconut - 1/2 cup unsweetened
Juice of 1 Lemon

In a large pot, over medium-high heat, toss in the chicken parts and brown (no longer pink on outside). 
  I throw in the onions when they are about half browned.

While the chicken is browning, soak the curry powder in a cup of warm water to make it pasty. 
Add the curry to the chicken and pour in stock or water to just cover the chicken. 
Add chick peas and coconut, save peas and potatoes until about 30 minutes before end of cooking.

Cover and simmer for an hour at least. Add lemon juice at the end.

Serve with rice or roti.

Lebanese Pickled Turnips

    2 cups water
    1 cup vinegar
    2 tsp. salt
    1 beetroot
    Several garlic cloves

Wash turnips well and cut off a slice from the tops and bottoms. 
Slice lengthwise into quarter-inch slices to within a half-inch of the bottom of the turnip. 
  Do not separate the slices entirely from each other. 
Soak in water overnight. Wash well in the morning. 
Place in glass jar with the beetroot, to give color to the pickles. 
Cover with the pickling solution prepared from the above ingredients.

These pickles may be eaten after three days.



Cajun Red Beans and Rice (u/2Cuil4School)

    1lb Red Kidney Beans, soaked overnight in enough water to cover, then drained
    1 tbsp Vegetable Oil
    2 medium Yellow Onions, diced
    1 large Green Bell Pepper, diced
    3 large stalks Celery, diced
    3 cloves Garlic, minced
    14-16oz package Andouille Sausage, sliced thin
    1 tsp Kosher Salt
    1/2 tsp Black Pepper
    1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper (or more, if you like)
    1 tsp Cajun Seasoning (I like Tony Chachere's)
    1 tsp Dried Thyme Leaves
    2 Bay Leaves
    ~6-8 cups Water

In a large stockpot or dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it's shimmering, then add in the 
onions, bell pepper, and celery. Cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are wilted 
and the onion's going translucent.

Add in the sausage and keep sauteing, stirring regularly, until it starts to take on a little color--4-5 
minutes should do. Add in the garlic and cook for one more minute, still stirring.

Mix in your dried spices and seasonings (salt, pepper, Cayenne, Cajun seasoning, thyme, and bay leaves), 
then pour in the beans and enough water to cover everything completely.

Raise the heat to high and bring the pot to a boil, then reduce it down to achieve a strong simmer and cook, 
partially covered, for about 1.5 - 2 hours, until the beans are very tender. Stir every so often--more regularly 
as the mixture starts to thicken. If, at any point, it looks thicker than you enjoy, add a little water.

If you're like me and enjoy really creamy beans, then take the time to mash anywhere between 1/4 and 2/3 of 
them against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden, or stiff plastic, spoon. Cook another 15-30 minutes 
after that to thicken further, stirring more frequently to avoid burning.

Serve hot over rice (see below), with a bottle of hot sauce at the ready.

Note: Just one note on the rice. Cajun rice isn't steamed like normal, they just throw some rice into a big pot of water 
      (or stock, if you want more flavor) and boil the hell out of it, then strain it. I usually do about 5:1 water to rice. 
	  Throw in some bay leaves and you're set. Souce: I'm the exec chef of a Cajun restaurant (u/crookedplatipus)

3/4 cup shredded carrots
3/4 cup diced celery
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
4 tablespoons butter, divided

1/4 cup sour cream

In a  3 qt pan, cook beef until no longer pink.  Drain and set aside.  In the same pan, sauté onion, carrots, celery,

Bring to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10  12 minutes or until potatoes are tender.

Meanwhile in a small skillet, melt remaining 3 tablespoons of butter.  Add flour and cook until bubbly.  Add to soup 
after potatoes are tender.  Bring soup to a boil and cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Add cheese, 
milk, salt and pepper.  Cook and stir until cheese melts.  Remove from the heat and blend in sour cream.  Yields 8

Tuna Noodle Casserole

10 1/2 ounces cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup diced yellow onion
1/2 cup diced celery
6 ounces albacore tuna
6 ounces cooked egg noodles
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
salt and pepper

Mix the cream of chicken, mayonnaise and milk together in a large bowl.
Add the diced celery and onion.
Fold in the tuna, followed by the cooked egg noodles and shredded cheddar cheese.
Salt and pepper to your taste.
Place in a casserole dish. Cook at 375 degrees for about 40-45 minutes, just until the top starts to brown.
	
Notes: I made a double batch using 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery soup. 
I added 1 cup frozen peas. You can probably go slightly scant on the mayo, maybe slightly heavy on the cheese. 
It's a really good recipe. Sauteing the veggies at first would be good too. I will try diced carrot instead of 
celery next time. And/or broccoli florets.



marthas macaroni-and-cheese (smitten kitchen)

8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for casserole
6 slices white bread, crusts removed, torn into 1/4- to l/2-inch pieces
5 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons coarse salt, plus more for water
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 1/2 cups (about 18 ounces) grated sharp white cheddar cheese
2 cups (about 8 ounces) grated Gruyère or 1 1/4 cups (about 5 ounces) grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 pound elbow macaroni

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter a 3-quart casserole dish; set aside. Place the bread in a medium bowl. 
   In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Pour the melted butter into the bowl 
   with the bread, and toss. Set the breadcrumbs aside.

2. Warm the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a high-sided 
   skillet over medium heat. When the butter bubbles, add the flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.

3. While whisking, slowly pour in the hot milk a little at a time to keep mixture smooth. Continue cooking, whisking 
   constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick, 8 to 12 minutes.

4. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 3 cups cheddar cheese, and 
   1 1/2 cups Gruyère (or 1 cup Pecorino Romano); set the cheese sauce aside.

5. Cover a large pot of salted water, and bring to a boil. Cook the macaroni until the outside of pasta is cooked 
   and the inside is underdone, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, 
   and drain well. Stir the macaroni into the reserved cheese sauce.

6. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup Gruyère 
   (or 1/4 cup Pecorino Romano), and the breadcrumbs over the top. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes 
   (though we needed a bit more time to get it brown, but your oven may vary). Transfer the dish to a wire rack for 
   5 minutes; serve.
   
   
The Food Lab's Ultra-Gooey Stovetop Mac and Cheese

    1 pound elbow macaroni
    Kosher salt
    One 12-ounce can evaporated milk
    2 large eggs
    1 teaspoon Franks RedHot or other hot sauce
    1 teaspoon ground mustard
    1 pound extra-sharp cheddar, grated (see note above)
    8 ounces American cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see note above)
    1 tablespoon cornstarch
    8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 chunks

1. Place the macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water by 2 inches. 
   Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking. 
   Cover the pan, remove from the heat, and let stand until the pasta is barely al dente, 
   about 8 minutes.
   
2. Meanwhile, whisk together the evaporated milk, eggs, hot sauce, and mustard in a bowl until 
   homogeneous. Toss the cheeses with the cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
   
3. When the pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan. Place over low heat, add the 
   butter, and stir until melted. Add the milk mixture and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, 
   until the cheese is completely melted and the mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt 
   and more hot sauce. Serve immediately, topping with toasted bread crumbs if desired.
   

   
Tartar Sauce

3/4 cup mayo
1/2 shallot, minced
2 Tablespoons capers, minced
2 Tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Mix all ingredients; let stand at least 15 minutes.



Baked Ziti with Sausage

1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta
1 pound mild Italian sausage
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 egg
1 large yellow onion, minced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce, divided
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend
1 teaspoon dried basil (optional)

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
Once the water is boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. 
Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is 
  still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. 
Add the sausage, and cook and stir until brown, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.
Stir together the ricotta, egg, onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until well combined. 
Stir in the drained pasta, the drained sausage, salt, pepper, and 1/2 jar of the spaghetti sauce; mix well.
In the prepared baking dish, cover the bottom with 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce. 
Layer 1/2 of the pasta mixture, 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. 
Then layer the remaining 1/2 of the pasta, 1/3 of the sauce, and 1/2 of the cheese. Sprinkle with basil. 
Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; return to the oven and bake 
until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.

Notes: Quite good. Needs a couple of modifications for success. First, saute onion and garlic with the sausage.
Add another pound of meat; either ground beef, pork, turkey or more sausage. This dish could handle spicy Italian sausage.
Use the listed spices as a minimum, otherwise reviews warn the end result can be bland. I added some dry parsley to the 
spice mixture. I used an Italian cheese mix between the pasta and sauce layers and it was good. I wondered if using a 
more assertive cheese, like asiago, would add some needed flavor. You may want to add a bit of grated parmessan on top 
of your shredded cheese. I think sauteing some peppers and mushrooms with the onion and meat would also produce a good 
result. Overall quite successful but use this recipe as a basic idea and build on the flavors more.



Slowcooker Thai Chicken Curry

1 14oz can coconut milk
1/4 cup peanut butter
2 T red curry paste
2 T fish sauce
3 T lime juice
2 T brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1 1/2 pounds chicken breast, cut up
1 red bell pepper, sliced and pre-sauted
 (may as well saute some onion too then)

toppings: cilantro, chopped peanut, green onion

Whisk everything but chicken together in crock pot.
Add chicken and stir.
Cook on low until chicken is done.

Notes: Does the pepper really need to be sauted separately
from everything else? Like I note in the recipe itself, if I'm
going to saute some red pepper I'm adding onion too.
